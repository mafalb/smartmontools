/* Structure used to store settings for specific drives in knowndrives[]. The
 * elements are used in the following ways:
 *
 *  modelfamily     Informal string about the model family/series of a 
 *                  device. Set to "" if no info (apart from device id)
 *                  known.
 *  modelregexp     POSIX regular expression to match the model of a device.
 *                  This should never be "".
 *  firmwareregexp  POSIX regular expression to match a devices's firmware
 *                  version.  This is optional and should be "" if it is not
 *                  to be used.  If it is nonempty then it will be used to
 *                  narrow the set of devices matched by modelregexp.
 *  warningmsg      A message that may be displayed for matching drives.  For
 *                  example, to inform the user that they may need to apply a
 *                  firmware patch.
 *  presets         String with vendor-specific attribute ('-v') and firmware
 *                  bug fix ('-F') options.  Same syntax as in smartctl command
 *                  line.  The user's own settings override these.
