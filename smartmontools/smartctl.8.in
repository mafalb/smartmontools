\fBsmartctl\fP \- Control and Monitor Utility for SMART Disks

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smartctl [options] device

.SH FULL PATH
.B /usr/local/sbin/smartctl

.SH PACKAGE VERSION
CURRENT_CVS_VERSION released CURRENT_CVS_DATE at CURRENT_CVS_TIME

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsmartctl\fP controls the Self\-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology (SMART) system built into many ATA\-3 and later ATA, IDE and
SCSI\-3 hard drives. The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability
of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out
different types of drive self\-tests.  This version of \fBsmartctl\fP
is compatible with ATA/ATAPI\-7 and earlier standards (see REFERENCES
below)

\fBsmartctl\fP is a command line utility designed to perform SMART
tasks such as printing the SMART self\-test and error logs, enabling
and disabling SMART automatic testing, and initiating device
self\-tests. Note: if the user issues a SMART command that is
(apparently) not implemented by the device, \fBsmartctl\fP will print
a warning message but issue the command anyway (see the \fB\-T,
\-\-tolerance\fP option below).  This should not cause problems: on
most devices, unimplemented SMART commands issued to a drive are
ignored and/or return an error.

\fBsmartctl\fP also provides support for polling TapeAlert messages
from SCSI tape drives and changers.

The user must specify the device to be controlled or interrogated as
the final argument to \fBsmartctl\fP. The command set used by the device
is often derived from the device path but may need help with the \'\-d\'
option (for more information see the section on "ATA, SCSI command sets
and SAT" below). Device paths are as follows:
.IP \fBLINUX\fP: 9
Use the forms \fB"/dev/hd[a\-t]"\fP for IDE/ATA devices, and
\fB"/dev/sd[a\-z]"\fP for SCSI devices. For SCSI Tape Drives and
Changers with TapeAlert support use the devices \fB"/dev/nst*"\fP and
\fB"/dev/sg*"\fP.  For SATA disks accessed with libata, use
\fB"/dev/sd[a\-z]"\fP and append \fB"\-d ata"\fP. For disks behind
3ware controllers you may need \fB"/dev/sd[a\-z]"\fP or
\fB"/dev/twe[0\-9]"\fP or \fB"/dev/twa[0\-9]"\fP: see details
below. For disks behind HighPoint RocketRAID controllers you may need
\fB"/dev/sd[a\-z]"\fP.  For disks behind Areca SATA RAID controllers,
you need \fB"/dev/sg[2\-9]"\fP (note that smartmontools interacts with
the Areca controllers via a SCSI generic device which is different
than the SCSI device used for reading and writing data)!
.IP \fBDARWIN\fP: 9
Use the forms \fB/dev/disk[0\-9]\fP or equivalently \fBdisk[0\-9]\fP or equivalently
\fB/dev/rdisk[0\-9]\fP.  Long forms are also available: please use \'\-h\' to see some
examples. Note that there is currently no Darwin SCSI support.
.IP \fBFREEBSD\fP: 9
Use the forms \fB"/dev/ad[0\-9]+"\fP for IDE/ATA
devices and \fB"/dev/da[0\-9]+"\fP for SCSI devices.
.IP \fBNETBSD/OPENBSD\fP: 9
Use the form \fB"/dev/wd[0\-9]+c"\fP for IDE/ATA
devices.  For SCSI disk and tape devices, use the device names
\fB"/dev/sd[0\-9]+c"\fP and \fB"/dev/st[0\-9]+c"\fP respectively.  
Be sure to specify the correct "whole disk" partition letter for 
your architecture.
.IP \fBSOLARIS\fP: 9
Use the forms \fB"/dev/rdsk/c?t?d?s?"\fP for IDE/ATA and SCSI disk
devices, and \fB"/dev/rmt/*"\fP for SCSI tape devices.
.IP \fBWINDOWS\ 9x/ME\fP: 9
Use the forms \fB"/dev/hd[a\-d]"\fP for standard IDE/ATA devices
accessed via SMARTVSD.VXD, and \fB"/dev/hd[e\-h]"\fP for additional devices
accessed via a patched SMARTVSE.VXD (see INSTALL file for details).
Use the form \fB"/dev/scsi[0\-9][0\-f]"\fP for SCSI devices via an aspi dll
on ASPI adapter 0\-9, ID 0\-15. The prefix \fB"/dev/"\fP is optional.
.IP \fBWINDOWS\ NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista\fP: 9
Use the forms \fB"/dev/sd[a\-z]"\fP for IDE/(S)ATA and SCSI disks
"\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive[0\-25]" (where "a" maps to "0").
These disks can also be referred to as \fB"/dev/pd[0\-255]"\fP for
"\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive[0\-255]".
ATA disks can also be referred to as \fB"/dev/hd[a\-z]"\fP for
"\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive[0\-25]". 
Use one the forms \fB"/dev/tape[0\-255]"\fP, \fB"/dev/st[0\-255]"\fP,
or \fB"/dev/nst[0\-255]"\fP for SCSI tape drives "\\\\.\\Tape[0\-255]".

Alternatively, drive letters \fB"X:"\fP or \fB"X:\\"\fP may be used to
specify the (\'basic\') disk behind a mounted partition.  This does
not work with \'dynamic\' disks.

For disks behind 3ware 9000 controllers use \fB"/dev/sd[a\-z],N"\fP where
N specifies the disk number (3ware \'port\') behind the controller
providing the logical drive (\'unit\') specified by \fB"/dev/sd[a\-z]"\fP.
Alternatively, use \fB"/dev/tw_cli/cx/py"\fP for controller x, port y
to run the \'tw_cli\' tool and parse the output. This provides limited
monitoring (\'\-i\', \'\-c\', \'\-A\' below) if SMART support is missing
in the driver. Use \fB"/dev/tw_cli/stdin"\fP or \fB"/dev/tw_cli/clip"\fP
to parse CLI or 3DM output from standard input or clipboard.
The option \'\-d 3ware,N\' is not necessary on Windows.
The prefix \fB"/dev/"\fP is optional.
.IP \fBCYGWIN\fP: 9
See "WINDOWS NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista" above.
.IP \fBOS/2,eComStation\fP: 9
Use the form \fB"/dev/hd[a\-z]"\fP for IDE/ATA devices.
.PP
if \'\-\' is specified as the device path, \fBsmartctl\fP reads and
interprets it's own debug output from standard input.
See \'\-r ataioctl\' below for details.
.PP
Based on the device path, \fBsmartctl\fP will guess the device type
(ATA or SCSI).  If necessary, the \'\-d\' option can be used to over\-ride
this guess

Note that the printed output of \fBsmartctl\fP displays most numerical
values in base 10 (decimal), but some values are displayed in base 16
(hexadecimal).  To distinguish them, the base 16 values are always
displayed with a leading \fB"0x"\fP, for example: "0xff". This man
page follows the same convention.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options are grouped below into several categories.  \fBsmartctl\fP
will execute the corresponding commands in the order: INFORMATION,
ENABLE/DISABLE, DISPLAY DATA, RUN/ABORT TESTS.

Long options  are  not  supported  on  all  systems.   Use
.B \'smartctl \-h\'
to see the available options.

.TP
.B SHOW INFORMATION OPTIONS:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help, \-\-usage
Prints a usage message to STDOUT and exits.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version, \-\-copyright, \-\-license
Prints version, copyright, license, home page and SVN revision
information for your copy of \fBsmartctl\fP to STDOUT and then exits.
Please include this information if you are reporting bugs or problems.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-info
Prints the device model number, serial number, firmware version, and
ATA Standard version/revision information.  Says if the device
supports SMART, and if so, whether SMART support is currently enabled
or disabled.  If the device supports Logical Block Address mode (LBA
mode) print current user drive capacity in bytes. (If drive is has a
user protected area reserved, or is "clipped", this may be smaller
than the potential maximum drive capacity.)  Indicates if the drive is
in the smartmontools database (see \'\-v\' options below).  If so, the
drive model family may also be printed. If \'\-n\' (see below) is
specified, the power mode of the drive is printed.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
Prints all SMART information about the disk, or TapeAlert information
about the tape drive or changer.  For ATA devices this is equivalent
to
.nf
\'\-H \-i \-c \-A \-l error \-l selftest \-l selective\'
.fi
and for SCSI, this is equivalent to
.nf
\'\-H \-i \-A \-l error \-l selftest\'.
.fi
Note that for ATA disks this does \fBnot\fP enable the non-SMART options
and the SMART options which require support for 48-bit ATA commands.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-xall
Prints all SMART and non-SMART information about the device. For ATA
devices this is equivalent to
.nf
\'\-H \-i \-c \-A \-l xerror,error \-l xselftest,selftest \-l selective
\-l directory \-l scttemp \-l sataphy\'.
.fi
and for SCSI, this is equivalent to
.nf
\'\-H \-i \-A \-l error \-l selftest \-l background \-l sasphy\'.
.fi

.TP
.B RUN\-TIME BEHAVIOR OPTIONS:
.TP
.B \-q TYPE, \-\-quietmode=TYPE
Specifies that \fBsmartctl\fP should run in one of the two quiet modes
described here.  The valid arguments to this option are:

.I errorsonly
\- only print: For the \'\-l error\' option, if nonzero, the number
of errors recorded in the SMART error log and the power\-on time when
they occurred; For the \'\-l selftest\' option, errors recorded in the device
self\-test log; For the \'\-H\' option, SMART "disk failing" status or device
Attributes (pre\-failure or usage) which failed either now or in the
past; For the \'\-A\' option, device Attributes (pre\-failure or usage)
which failed either now or in the past.

.I silent
\- print no output.  The only way to learn about what was found is to
use the exit status of \fBsmartctl\fP (see RETURN VALUES below).

.I noserial
\- Do not print the serial number of the device.

.TP
.B \-d TYPE, \-\-device=TYPE
Specifies the type of the device.  The valid arguments to this option
are \fIata\fP, \fIscsi\fP, \fIsat\fP, \fImarvell\fP, \fI3ware,N\fP,
\fIareca,N\fP, \fIusbcypress\fP, \fIusbjmicron\fP, \fIusbsunplus\fP,
\fIcciss,N\fP, \fIhpt,L/M\fP (or \fIhpt,L/M/N\fP), and \fItest\fP.

If this option is not used then \fBsmartctl\fP will attempt to guess
the device type from the device name or from controller type info
provided by the operating system.

If \'test\' is used as the TYPE name, \fBsmartctl\fP prints the guessed
TYPE name, then opens the device and prints the (possibly changed) TYPE
name and then exists without performing any further commands.

The \'sat\' device type is for ATA disks that have a SCSI to ATA
Translation (SAT) Layer (SATL) between the disk and the operating system.
SAT defines two ATA PASS THROUGH SCSI commands, one 12 bytes long and
the other 16 bytes long that \fBsmartctl\fP will utilize when this device
type is selected. The default is the 16 byte variant which can be
overridden with either \'\-d sat,12\' or \'\-d sat,16\'.

The \'usbcypress\' device type is for ATA disks that are behind a Cypress
usb-pata bridge. This will use the ATACB proprietary scsi pass through command. There is no autodetection at the moment. The best way to know if your device support it, is to check your device usb id (most Cypress usb ata bridge got vid=0x04b4, pid=0x6830) or to try it (if the usb device doesn't support ATACB, smartmontools print an error).
The default scsi operation code is 0x24, but although it can be overridden
with \'\-d usbcypress,0xn\', where n is the scsi operation code,
you're running the risk of damage to the device or filesystems on it.

[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] The \'usbjmicron\' device type is for
SATA disks that are behind a JMicron USB to PATA/SATA bridge. The 48-bit
ATA commands (required e.g. for \'\-l xerror\', see below) do not work with
all of these bridges and are therefore disabled by default. These commands
can be enabled by \'\-d usbjmicron,x\'. CAUTION: Specifying \',x\' for a
device which do not support it results in I/O errors and may disconnect
the drive. The port can be specified by \'\-d usbjmicron[,x],PORT\' where
PORT is 0 (master) or 1 (slave). This is not necessary if only one disk is
connected to the USB bridge. If two disks are connected, an error message
is printed if no PORT is specified.

[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] The \'usbsunplus\' device type is for
SATA disks that are behind a SunplusIT USB to SATA bridge.

Under Linux, to look at SATA disks behind Marvell SATA controllers
(using Marvell's \'linuxIAL\' driver rather than libata driver) use \'\-d marvell\'. Such
controllers show up as Marvell Technology Group Ltd. SATA I or II controllers
using lspci, or using lspci \-n show a vendor ID 0x11ab and a device ID of
either 0x5040, 0x5041, 0x5080, 0x5081, 0x6041 or 0x6081. The \'linuxIAL\' driver
seems not (yet?) available in the Linux kernel source tree, but should be available
from system vendors (ftp://ftp.aslab.com/ is known to provide a patch with the driver).

Under Linux , to look at SCSI/SAS disks behind LSI MegaRAID controllers,
use syntax such as:
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d megaraid,2 /dev/sda\fP
.fi
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d megaraid,0 /dev/sdb\fP
.fi
where in the argument \fImegaraid,N\fP, the integer N is the physical disk
number within the MegaRAID controller.  This interface will also work for
Dell PERC controllers.  The following /dev/XXX entry must exist:
.fi
For PERC2/3/4 controllers: \fB/dev/megadev0\fP
.fi
For PERC5/6 controllers: \fB/dev/megaraid_sas_ioctl_node\fP

Under Linux and FreeBSD, to look at ATA disks behind 3ware SCSI RAID controllers,
use syntax such as:
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d 3ware,2 /dev/sda\fP
.fi
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0\fP
.fi
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d 3ware,1 /dev/twa0\fP
.fi
where in the argument \fI3ware,N\fP, the integer N is the disk number
(3ware \'port\') within the 3ware ATA RAID controller.  The allowed
values of N are from 0 to 127 inclusive.  The first two forms, which
refer to devices /dev/sda\-z and /dev/twe0\-15, may be used with 3ware
series 6000, 7000, and 8000 series controllers that use the 3x\-xxxx
driver.  \fBNote that the /dev/sda\-z form is deprecated\fP starting
with the Linux 2.6 kernel series and may not be supported by the Linux
kernel in the near future. The final form, which refers to devices
/dev/twa0\-15, must be used with 3ware 9000 series controllers, which
use the 3w\-9xxx driver.

Note that if the special character device nodes /dev/twa? and
/dev/twe? do not exist, or exist with the incorrect major or minor
numbers, smartctl will recreate them on the fly.  Typically /dev/twa0
refers to the first 9000\-series controller, /dev/twa1 refers to the
second 9000 series controller, and so on. Likewise /dev/twe0 refers to
the first 6/7/8000\-series controller, /dev/twa1 refers to the second
6/7/8000 series controller, and so on.

Note that for the 6/7/8000 controllers, \fBany\fP of the physical
disks can be queried or examined using \fBany\fP of the 3ware's SCSI
logical device /dev/sd?  entries.  Thus, if logical device /dev/sda is
made up of two physical disks (3ware ports zero and one) and logical
device /dev/sdb is made up of two other physical disks (3ware ports
two and three) then you can examine the SMART data on \fBany\fP of the
four physical disks using \fBeither\fP SCSI device /dev/sda \fBor\fP
/dev/sdb.  If you need to know which logical SCSI device a particular
physical disk (3ware port) is associated with, use the dmesg or SYSLOG
output to show which SCSI ID corresponds to a particular 3ware unit,
and then use the 3ware CLI or 3dm tool to determine which ports
(physical disks) correspond to particular 3ware units.

If the value of N corresponds to a port that does \fBnot\fP exist on
the 3ware controller, or to a port that does not physically have a
disk attached to it, the behavior of \fBsmartctl\fP depends upon the
specific controller model, firmware, Linux kernel and platform.  In
some cases you will get a warning message that the device does not
exist. In other cases you will be presented with \'void\' data for a
non\-existent device.

Note that if the /dev/sd? addressing form is used, then older 3w\-xxxx
drivers do not pass the "Enable Autosave"
(\'\fB\-S on\fP\') and "Enable Automatic Offline" (\'\fB\-o on\fP\')
commands to the disk, and produce these types of harmless syslog error
messages instead: "\fB3w\-xxxx: tw_ioctl(): Passthru size (123392) too
big\fP". This can be fixed by upgrading to version 1.02.00.037 or
later of the 3w\-xxxx driver, or by applying a patch to older
versions. See \fBhttp://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/\fP for
instructions.  Alternatively, use the character device /dev/twe0\-15 interface.

The selective self\-test functions (\'\-t select,A\-B\') are only supported
using the character device interface /dev/twa0\-15 and /dev/twe0\-15.
The necessary WRITE LOG commands can not be passed through the SCSI
interface.

.B Areca SATA RAID controllers are currently supported under Linux only.
To look at SATA disks behind Areca RAID controllers, use syntax such
as:
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d areca,2 /dev/sg2\fP
.fi
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d areca,3 /dev/sg3\fP
.fi
where in the argument \fIareca,N\fP, the integer N is the disk number
(Areca \'port\') within the Areca SATA RAID controller.  The allowed
values of N are from 1 to 24 inclusive.  The first line above
addresses the second disk on the first Areca RAID controller.  The
second line addresses the third disk on the second Areca RAID
controller.  To help identify the correct device, use the command:
.nf
\fBcat /proc/scsi/sg/device_hdr /proc/scsi/sg/devices\fP
.fi
to show the SCSI generic devices (one per line, starting with
/dev/sg0). The correct SCSI generic devices to address for
smartmontools are the ones with the type field equal to 3.  If the
incorrect device is addressed, please read the warning/error messages
carefully.  They should provide hints about what devices to use.

Important: the Areca controller must have firmware version 1.46 or
later. Lower-numbered firmware versions will give (harmless) SCSI
error messages and no SMART information.

To look at (S)ATA disks behind HighPoint RocketRAID controllers, use syntax
such as:
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d hpt,1/3 /dev/sda\fP    (under Linux)
.fi
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d hpt,1/2/3 /dev/sda\fP    (under Linux)
.fi
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d hpt,1/3 /dev/hptrr\fP    (under FreeBSD)
.fi
.nf
\fBsmartctl \-a \-d hpt,1/2/3 /dev/hptrr\fP    (under FreeBSD)
.fi
where in the argument \fIhpt,L/M\fP or \fIhpt,L/M/N\fP, the integer L is the
controller id, the integer M is the channel number, and the integer N is the
PMPort number if it is available. The allowed values of L are from 1 to 4
inclusive, M are from 1 to 8 inclusive and N from 1 to 5 if PMPort available.
Note that the /dev/sda\-z form should be the device node which stands for
the disks derived from the HighPoint RocketRAID controllers under Linux and
under FreeBSD, it is the character device which the driver registered (eg,
/dev/hptrr, /dev/hptmv6).  And also these values are limited by the model
of the HighPoint RocketRAID controller.

.B HighPoint RocketRAID controllers are currently ONLY supported under Linux and FreeBSD.

.B cciss controllers are currently ONLY supported under Linux and FreeBSD.

.TP
.B \-T TYPE, \-\-tolerance=TYPE
[ATA only] Specifies how tolerant \fBsmartctl\fP should be of ATA and SMART
command failures. 

The behavior of \fBsmartctl\fP depends upon whether the command is
"\fBoptional\fP" or "\fBmandatory\fP". Here "\fBmandatory\fP" means
"required by the ATA/ATAPI\-5 Specification if the device implements
the SMART command set" and "\fBoptional\fP" means "not required by the
ATA/ATAPI\-5 Specification even if the device implements the SMART
command set."  The "\fBmandatory\fP" ATA and SMART commands are: (1)
ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE, (2) SMART ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE, (3)
SMART ENABLE/DISABLE, and (4) SMART RETURN STATUS.

The valid arguments to this option are:

.I normal
\- exit on failure of any \fBmandatory\fP SMART command, and ignore
all failures of \fBoptional\fP SMART commands.  This is the default.
Note that on some devices, issuing unimplemented optional SMART
commands doesn\'t cause an error.  This can result in misleading
\fBsmartctl\fP messages such as "Feature X not implemented", followed
shortly by "Feature X: enabled".  In most such cases, contrary to the
final message, Feature X is \fBnot\fP enabled.

.I conservative
\- exit on failure of any \fBoptional\fP SMART command.

.I permissive
\- ignore failure(s) of \fBmandatory\fP SMART commands.  This option
may be given more than once.  Each additional use of this option will
cause one more additional failure to be ignored.  Note that the use of
this option can lead to messages like "Feature X not implemented",
followed shortly by "Error: unable to enable Feature X".  In a few
such cases, contrary to the final message, Feature X \fBis\fP enabled.

.I verypermissive
\- equivalent to giving a large number of \'\-T permissive\' options:
ignore failures of \fBany number\fP of \fBmandatory\fP SMART commands.
Please see the note above.

.TP
.B \-b TYPE, \-\-badsum=TYPE
[ATA only] Specifies the action \fBsmartctl\fP should take if a checksum
error is detected in the: (1) Device Identity Structure, (2) SMART
Self\-Test Log Structure, (3) SMART Attribute Value Structure, (4) SMART
Attribute Threshold Structure, or (5) ATA Error Log Structure.

The valid arguments to this option are:

.I warn
\- report the incorrect checksum but carry on in spite of it.  This is the
default.

.I exit
\- exit \fBsmartctl\fP.

.I ignore
\- continue silently without issuing a warning.

.TP
.B \-r TYPE, \-\-report=TYPE
Intended primarily to help \fBsmartmontools\fP developers understand
the behavior of \fBsmartmontools\fP on non\-conforming or poorly
conforming hardware.  This option reports details of \fBsmartctl\fP
transactions with the device.  The option can be used multiple times.
When used just once, it shows a record of the ioctl() transactions
with the device.  When used more than once, the detail of these
ioctl() transactions are reported in greater detail.  The valid
arguments to this option are:

.I ioctl
\- report all ioctl() transactions.

.I ataioctl
\- report only ioctl() transactions with ATA devices.

.I scsiioctl
\- report only ioctl() transactions with SCSI devices. Invoking this once
shows the SCSI commands in hex and the corresponding status. Invoking
it a second time adds a hex listing of the first 64 bytes of data send to, 
or received from the device.

Any argument may include a positive integer to specify the level of detail
that should be reported.  The argument should be followed by a comma then
the integer with no spaces.  For example, 
.I ataioctl,2
The default
level is 1, so \'\-r ataioctl,1\' and \'\-r ataioctl\' are equivalent.

For testing purposes, the output of \'\-r ataioctl,2\' can later be parsed
by \fBsmartctl\fP itself if \'\-\' is used as device path argument.
The ATA command input parameters, sector data and return values are
reconstructed from the debug report read from stdin.
Then \fBsmartctl\fP internally simulates an ATA device with the same
behaviour. This is does not work for SCSI devices yet.

.TP
.B \-n POWERMODE, \-\-nocheck=POWERMODE
[ATA only] Specifies if \fBsmartctl\fP should exit before performing any
checks when the device is in a low\-power mode. It may be used to prevent
a disk from being spun\-up by \fBsmartctl\fP. The power mode is ignored by
default. The allowed values of POWERMODE are:

.I never
\- check the device always, but print the power mode if \'\-i\' is
specified.

.I sleep
\- check the device unless it is in SLEEP mode.

.I standby
\- check the device unless it is in SLEEP or STANDBY mode.  In
these modes most disks are not spinning, so if you want to prevent
a disk from spinning up, this is probably what you want.

.I idle
\- check the device unless it is in SLEEP, STANDBY or IDLE mode.
In the IDLE state, most disks are still spinning, so this is probably
not what you want.

.TP
.B SMART FEATURE ENABLE/DISABLE COMMANDS:
.IP
.B Note: 
if multiple options are used to both enable and disable a
feature, then 
.B both
the enable and disable commands will be issued.  The enable command
will always be issued
.B before
the corresponding disable command.
.TP
.B \-s VALUE, \-\-smart=VALUE 
Enables or disables SMART on device.  The valid arguments to
this option are \fIon\fP and \fIoff\fP.  Note that the command \'\-s on\'
(perhaps used with with the \'\-o on\' and \'\-S on\' options) should be
placed in a start\-up script for your machine, for example in rc.local or
rc.sysinit. In principle the SMART feature settings are preserved over
power\-cycling, but it doesn\'t hurt to be sure. It is not necessary (or
useful) to enable SMART to see the TapeAlert messages.
.TP
.B \-o VALUE, \-\-offlineauto=VALUE
[ATA only] Enables or disables SMART automatic offline test, which scans the
drive every four hours for disk defects. This command can be given during
normal system operation.  The valid arguments to this option are \fIon\fP
and \fIoff\fP.

Note that the SMART automatic offline test command is listed as
"Obsolete" in every version of the ATA and ATA/ATAPI Specifications.
It was originally part of the SFF\-8035i Revision 2.0 specification,
but was never part of any ATA specification.  However it is
implemented and used by many vendors. [Good documentation can be found
in IBM\'s Official Published Disk Specifications.  For example the IBM
Travelstar 40GNX Hard Disk Drive Specifications (Revision 1.1, 22
April 2002, Publication # 1541, Document S07N\-7715\-02) page 164. You
can also read the SFF\-8035i Specification \-\- see REFERENCES below.]
You can tell if automatic offline testing is supported by seeing if
this command enables and disables it, as indicated by the \'Auto
Offline Data Collection\' part of the SMART capabilities report
(displayed with \'\-c\').

SMART provides \fBthree\fP basic categories of testing.  The
\fBfirst\fP category, called "online" testing, has no effect on the
performance of the device.  It is turned on by the \'\-s on\' option.

The \fBsecond\fP category of testing is called "offline" testing. This
type of test can, in principle, degrade the device performance.  The
\'\-o on\' option causes this offline testing to be carried out,
automatically, on a regular scheduled basis.  Normally, the disk will
suspend offline testing while disk accesses are taking place, and then
automatically resume it when the disk would otherwise be idle, so in
practice it has little effect.  Note that a one\-time offline test can
also be carried out immediately upon receipt of a user command.  See
the \'\-t offline\' option below, which causes a one\-time offline test
to be carried out immediately.

The choice (made by the SFF\-8035i and ATA specification authors) of
the word \fItesting\fP for these first two categories is unfortunate,
and often leads to confusion.  In fact these first two categories of
online and offline testing could have been more accurately described
as online and offline \fBdata collection\fP.

The results of this automatic or immediate offline testing (data
collection) are reflected in the values of the SMART Attributes.
Thus, if problems or errors are detected, the values of these
Attributes will go below their failure thresholds; some types of
errors may also appear in the SMART error log. These are visible with
the \'\-A\' and \'\-l error\' options respectively.

Some SMART attribute values are updated only during off\-line data
collection activities; the rest are updated during normal operation of
the device or during both normal operation and off\-line testing.  The
Attribute value table produced by the \'\-A\' option indicates this in
the UPDATED column.  Attributes of the first type are labeled
"Offline" and Attributes of the second type are labeled "Always".

The \fBthird\fP category of testing (and the \fIonly\fP category for
which the word \'testing\' is really an appropriate choice) is "self"
testing.  This third type of test is only performed (immediately) when
a command to run it is issued.  The \'\-t\' and \'\-X\' options can be
used to carry out and abort such self\-tests; please see below for
further details.

Any errors detected in the self testing will be shown in the
SMART self\-test log, which can be examined using the \'\-l selftest\'
option.

\fBNote:\fP in this manual page, the word \fB"Test"\fP is used in
connection with the second category just described, e.g. for the
"offline" testing.  The words \fB"Self\-test"\fP are used in
connection with the third category.
.TP
.B \-S VALUE, \-\-saveauto=VALUE
Enables or disables SMART autosave of device vendor\-specific
Attributes. The valid arguments to this option are \fIon\fP
and \fIoff\fP.  Note that this feature is preserved across disk power
cycles, so you should only need to issue it once.

For SCSI devices this toggles the value of the Global Logging Target
Save Disabled (GLTSD) bit in the Control Mode Page. Some disk
manufacturers set this bit by default. This prevents error counters,
power\-up hours and other useful data from being placed in non\-volatile
storage, so these values may be reset to zero the next time the device
is power\-cycled.  If the GLTSD bit is set then \'smartctl \-a\' will
issue a warning. Use \fIon\fP to clear the GLTSD bit and thus enable
saving counters to non\-volatile storage. For extreme streaming\-video
type applications you might consider using \fIoff\fP to set the GLTSD
bit.

.TP
.B SMART READ AND DISPLAY DATA OPTIONS:
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-health
Check: Ask the device to report its SMART health status or pending
TapeAlert messages.  SMART status is based on
information that it has gathered from online and offline
tests, which were used to determine/update its
SMART vendor\-specific Attribute values. TapeAlert status is obtained
by reading the TapeAlert log page.

If the device reports failing health status, this means
.B either
that the device has already failed, 
.B or 
that it is predicting its own failure within the next 24 hours.  If
this happens, use the \'\-a\' option to get more information, and
.B get your data off the disk and to someplace safe as soon as you can.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-capabilities
[ATA only] Prints only the generic SMART capabilities.  These
show what SMART features are implemented and how the device will
respond to some of the different SMART commands.  For example it
shows if the device logs errors, if it supports offline surface
scanning, and so on.  If the device can carry out self\-tests, this
option also shows the estimated time required to run those tests.

Note that the time required to run the Self\-tests (listed in minutes)
are fixed.  However the time required to run the Immediate Offline
Test (listed in seconds) is variable.  This means that if you issue a
command to perform an Immediate Offline test with the \'\-t offline\' option,
then the time may jump to a larger value and then count down as the
Immediate Offline Test is carried out.  Please see REFERENCES below
for further information about the the flags and capabilities described
by this option.
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-attributes
[ATA] Prints only the vendor specific SMART Attributes.  The Attributes
are numbered from 1 to 253 and have specific names and ID numbers. For
example Attribute 12 is "power cycle count": how many times has the
disk been powered up.

Each Attribute has a "Raw" value, printed under the heading
"RAW_VALUE", and a "Normalized" value printed under the heading
"VALUE".  [Note: \fBsmartctl\fP prints these values in base\-10.]  In
the example just given, the "Raw Value" for Attribute 12 would be the
actual number of times that the disk has been power\-cycled, for
example 365 if the disk has been turned on once per day for exactly
one year.  Each vendor uses their own algorithm to convert this "Raw"
value to a "Normalized" value in the range from 1 to 254.  Please keep
in mind that \fBsmartctl\fP only reports the different Attribute
types, values, and thresholds as read from the device.  It does
\fBnot\fP carry out the conversion between "Raw" and "Normalized"
values: this is done by the disk\'s firmware.

The conversion from Raw value to a quantity with physical units is
not specified by the SMART standard. In most cases, the values printed
by \fBsmartctl\fP are sensible.  For example the temperature Attribute
generally has its raw value equal to the temperature in Celsius.
However in some cases vendors use unusual conventions.  For example
the Hitachi disk on my laptop reports its power\-on hours in minutes,
not hours. Some IBM disks track three temperatures rather than one, in
their raw values.  And so on.

Each Attribute also has a Threshold value (whose range is 0 to 255)
which is printed under the heading "THRESH".  If the Normalized value
is \fBless than or equal to\fP the Threshold value, then the Attribute
is said to have failed.  If the Attribute is a pre\-failure Attribute,
then disk failure is imminent.

Each Attribute also has a "Worst" value shown under the heading
"WORST".  This is the smallest (closest to failure) value that the
disk has recorded at any time during its lifetime when SMART was
enabled.  [Note however that some vendors firmware may actually
\fBincrease\fP the "Worst" value for some "rate\-type" Attributes.]

The Attribute table printed out by \fBsmartctl\fP also shows the
"TYPE" of the Attribute. Attributes are one of two possible types:
Pre\-failure or Old age.  Pre\-failure Attributes are ones which, if
less than or equal to their threshold values, indicate pending disk
failure.  Old age, or usage Attributes, are ones which indicate
end\-of\-product life from old\-age or normal aging and wearout, if
the Attribute value is less than or equal to the threshold.  \fBPlease
note\fP: the fact that an Attribute is of type 'Pre\-fail' does
\fBnot\fP mean that your disk is about to fail!  It only has this
meaning if the Attribute\'s current Normalized value is less than or
equal to the threshold value.

If the Attribute\'s current Normalized value is less than or equal to
the threshold value, then the "WHEN_FAILED" column will display
"FAILING_NOW". If not, but the worst recorded value is less than or
equal to the threshold value, then this column will display
"In_the_past".  If the "WHEN_FAILED" column has no entry (indicated by
a dash: \'\-\') then this Attribute is OK now (not failing) and has
also never failed in the past.

The table column labeled "UPDATED" shows if the SMART Attribute values
are updated during both normal operation and off\-line testing, or
only during offline testing.  The former are labeled "Always" and the
latter are labeled "Offline".

So to summarize: the Raw Attribute values are the ones that might have
a real physical interpretation, such as "Temperature Celsius",
"Hours", or "Start\-Stop Cycles".  Each manufacturer converts these,
using their detailed knowledge of the disk\'s operations and failure
modes, to Normalized Attribute values in the range 1\-254.  The
current and worst (lowest measured) of these Normalized Attribute
values are stored on the disk, along with a Threshold value that the
manufacturer has determined will indicate that the disk is going to
fail, or that it has exceeded its design age or aging limit.
\fBsmartctl\fP does \fBnot\fP calculate any of the Attribute values,
thresholds, or types, it merely reports them from the SMART data on
the device.

Note that starting with ATA/ATAPI\-4, revision 4, the meaning of these
Attribute fields has been made entirely vendor\-specific.  However most
ATA/ATAPI\-5 disks seem to respect their meaning, so we have retained
the option of printing the Attribute values.

[SCSI] For SCSI devices the "attributes" are obtained from the temperature
and start\-stop cycle counter log pages. Certain vendor specific
attributes are listed if recognised. The attributes are output in a
relatively free format (compared with ATA disk attributes).
.TP
.B \-l TYPE, \-\-log=TYPE
Prints either the SMART Error Log, the SMART Self\-Test Log, the SMART
Selective Self\-Test Log [ATA only], the Log Directory [ATA only], or
the Background Scan Results Log [SCSI only].
The valid arguments to this option are:

.I error
\- [ATA] prints the Summary SMART error log.  SMART disks maintain a log
of the most recent five non\-trivial errors. For each of these errors, the
disk power\-on lifetime at which the error occurred is recorded, as is
the device status (idle, standby, etc) at the time of the error.  For
some common types of errors, the Error Register (ER) and Status
Register (SR) values are decoded and printed as text. The meanings of these
are:
.nf
   \fBABRT\fP:  Command \fBAB\fPo\fBRT\fPed
   \fBAMNF\fP:  \fBA\fPddress \fBM\fPark \fBN\fPot \fBF\fPound
   \fBCCTO\fP:  \fBC\fPommand \fBC\fPompletion \fBT\fPimed \fBO\fPut
   \fBEOM\fP:   \fBE\fPnd \fBO\fPf \fBM\fPedia
   \fBICRC\fP:  \fBI\fPnterface \fBC\fPyclic \fBR\fPedundancy \fBC\fPode (CRC) error
   \fBIDNF\fP:  \fBID\fPentity \fBN\fPot \fBF\fPound
   \fBILI\fP:   (packet command\-set specific)
   \fBMC\fP:    \fBM\fPedia \fBC\fPhanged
   \fBMCR\fP:   \fBM\fPedia \fBC\fPhange \fBR\fPequest
   \fBNM\fP:    \fBN\fPo \fBM\fPedia
   \fBobs\fP:   \fBobs\fPolete
   \fBTK0NF\fP: \fBT\fPrac\fBK 0 N\fPot \fBF\fPound
   \fBUNC\fP:   \fBUNC\fPorrectable Error in Data
   \fBWP\fP:    Media is \fBW\fPrite \fBP\fProtected
.fi
In addition, up to the last five commands that preceded the error are
listed, along with a timestamp measured from the start of the
corresponding power cycle. This is displayed in the form
Dd+HH:MM:SS.msec where D is the number of days, HH is hours, MM is
minutes, SS is seconds and msec is milliseconds.  [Note: this time
stamp wraps after 2^32 milliseconds, or 49 days 17 hours 2 minutes and
47.296 seconds.]  The key ATA disk registers are also recorded in the
log.  The final column of the error log is a text\-string description
of the ATA command defined by the Command Register (CR) and Feature
Register (FR) values.  Commands that are obsolete in the most current
(ATA\-7) spec are listed like this: \fBREAD LONG (w/ retry) [OBS\-4]\fP,
indicating that the command became obsolete with or in the ATA\-4
specification.  Similarly, the notation \fB[RET\-\fP\fIN\fP\fB]\fP is
used to indicate that a command was retired in the ATA\-\fIN\fP
specification.  Some commands are not defined in any version of the
ATA specification but are in common use nonetheless; these are marked
\fB[NS]\fP, meaning non\-standard.

The ATA Specification (ATA\-5 Revision 1c, Section 8.41.6.8.2) says:
\fB"Error log structures shall include UNC errors, IDNF errors for
which the address requested was valid, servo errors, write fault
errors, etc.  Error log data structures shall not include errors
attributed to the receipt of faulty commands such as command codes not
implemented by the device or requests with invalid parameters or
invalid addresses."\fP The definitions of these terms are:
.br
\fBUNC\fP (\fBUNC\fPorrectable): data is uncorrectable.  This refers
to data which has been read from the disk, but for which the Error
Checking and Correction (ECC) codes are inconsistent.  In effect, this
means that the data can not be read.
.br
\fBIDNF\fP (\fBID N\fPot \fBF\fPound): user\-accessible address could
not be found. For READ LOG type commands, \fBIDNF\fP can also indicate
that a device data log structure checksum was incorrect.

If the command that caused the error was a READ or WRITE command, then
the Logical Block Address (LBA) at which the error occurred will be
printed in base 10 and base 16.  The LBA is a linear address, which
counts 512\-byte sectors on the disk, starting from zero.  (Because of
the limitations of the SMART error log, if the LBA is greater than
0xfffffff, then either no error log entry will be made, or the error
log entry will have an incorrect LBA. This may happen for drives with
a capacity greater than 128 GiB or 137 GB.) On Linux systems the
smartmontools web page has instructions about how to convert the LBA
address to the name of the disk file containing the erroneous disk
sector.

Please note that some manufacturers \fBignore\fP the ATA
specifications, and make entries in the error log if the device
receives a command which is not implemented or is not valid.

.I error
\- [SCSI] prints the error counter log pages for reads, write and verifies.
The verify row is only output if it has an element other than zero.

.I xerror[,NUM][,error]
\- [ATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints the Extended
Comprehensive SMART error log (General Purpose Log address 0x03).
Unlike the Summary SMART error log (see \'\-l error\' above),
it provides sufficient space to log the contents of the 48-bit
LBA register set introduced with ATA-6.  It also supports logs
with more than one sector.  Each sector holds up to 4 log entries.
The actual number of log sectors is vendor specific, typical values
for HDD are 2 (Samsung), 5 (Seagate) or 6 (WD). Some recent SSD devices
have much larger error logs.

Only the 8 most recent error log entries are printed by default.
This number can be changed by the optional parameter NUM.

If ',error' is appended and the Extended Comprehensive SMART error
log is not supported, the Summary SMART self-test log is printed.

Please note that some recent (e.g. Samsung) drives report errors only
in the Comprehensive SMART error log. The Summary SMART error log can
be read but is always empty.

.I selftest
\- [ATA] prints the SMART self\-test log.  The disk maintains a self\-test
log showing the results of the self tests, which can be run using the
\'\-t\' option described below.  For each of the most recent
twenty\-one self\-tests, the log shows the type of test (short or
extended, off\-line or captive) and the final status of the test.  If
the test did not complete successfully, then the percentage of the
test remaining is shown.  The time at which the test took place,
measured in hours of disk lifetime, is also printed. [Note: this time
stamp wraps after 2^16 hours, or 2730 days and 16 hours, or about 7.5
years.] If any errors were detected, the Logical Block Address (LBA)
of the first error is printed in decimal notation.  On Linux systems the
smartmontools web page has instructions about how to convert this LBA
address to the name of the disk file containing the erroneous block.

.I selftest
\- [SCSI] the self\-test log for a SCSI device has a slightly different
format than for an ATA device.  For each of the most recent twenty
self\-tests, it shows the type of test and the status (final or in
progress) of the test. SCSI standards use the terms "foreground" and
"background" (rather than ATA\'s corresponding "captive" and
"off\-line") and "short" and "long" (rather than ATA\'s corresponding
"short" and "extended") to describe the type of the test.  The printed
segment number is only relevant when a test fails in the third or
later test segment.  It identifies the test that failed and consists
of either the number of the segment that failed during the test, or
the number of the test that failed and the number of the segment in
which the test was run, using a vendor\-specific method of putting both
numbers into a single byte.  The Logical Block Address (LBA) of the
first error is printed in hexadecimal notation.  On Linux systems the
smartmontools web page has instructions about how to convert this LBA
address to the name of the disk file containing the erroneous block.
If provided, the SCSI Sense Key (SK), Additional Sense Code (ASC) and
Additional Sense Code Qualifier (ASQ) are also printed. The self tests
can be run using the \'\-t\' option described below (using the ATA
test terminology).

.I xselftest[,NUM][,selftest]
\- [ATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints the Extended
SMART self\-test log (General Purpose Log address 0x07). Unlike the SMART
self\-test log (see \'\-l selftest\' above), it supports 48-bit LBA
and logs with more than one sector.  Each sector holds up to 19 log
entries. The actual number of log sectors is vendor specific, typical
values are 1 (Seagate) or 2 (Samsung).

Only the 25 most recent log entries are printed by default. This number
can be changed by the optional parameter NUM.

If ',selftest' is appended and the Extended SMART self-test log is not
supported, the old SMART self-test log is printed.

.I selective
\- [ATA only] Please see the \'\-t select\' option below for a
description of selective self\-tests.  The selective self\-test log
shows the start/end Logical Block Addresses (LBA) of each of the five
test spans, and their current test status.  If the span is being
tested or the remainder of the disk is being read\-scanned, the
current 65536\-sector block of LBAs being tested is also displayed.
The selective self\-test log also shows if a read\-scan of the
remainder of the disk will be carried out after the selective
self\-test has completed (see \'\-t afterselect\' option) and the time
delay before restarting this read\-scan if it is interrupted (see
\'\-t pending\' option). This is a new smartmontools feature; please
report unusual or incorrect behavior to the smartmontools\-support
mailing list.

.I directory[,gs]
\- [ATA only] if the device supports the General Purpose Logging feature
set (ATA\-6 and above) then this prints the Log Directory (the log at
address 0).  The Log Directory shows what logs are available and their
length in sectors (512 bytes).  The contents of the logs at address 1
[Summary SMART error log] and at address 6 [SMART self\-test log] may
be printed using the previously\-described
.I error
and
.I selftest
arguments to this option.
If your version of smartctl supports 48-bit ATA commands, both the
General Purpose Log (GPL) and SMART Log (SL) directories are printed in
one combined table. The output can be restricted to the GPL directory or
SL directory by \'\-l directory,q\' or \'\-l directory,s\' respectively.

.I background
\- [SCSI only] the background scan results log outputs information derived
from Background Media Scans (BMS) done after power up and/or periodocally
(e.g. every 24 hours) on recent SCSI disks. If supported, the BMS status
is output first, indicating whether a background scan is currently
underway (and if so a progress percentage), the amount of time the disk
has been powered up and the number of scans already completed. Then there
is a header and a line for each background scan "event". These will
typically be either recovered or unrecoverable errors. That latter group
may need some attention. There is a description of the background scan
mechansim in section 4.18 of SBC\-3 revision 6 (see www.t10.org ).

.I scttemp, scttempsts, scttemphist
\- [ATA only] prints the disk temperature information provided by the
SMART Command Transport (SCT) commands.
The option \'scttempsts\' prints current temperature and temperature
ranges returned by the SCT Status command, \'scttemphist\' prints
temperature limits and the temperature history table returned by
the SCT Data Table command, and \'scttemp\' prints both.
The temperature values are preserved across power cycles.
The default temperature logging interval is 1 minute and can be
configured with the \'\-t scttempint,N[,p]\' option, see below.
The SCT commands are specified in the proposed ATA\-8 Command Set
(ACS), and are already implemented in some recent ATA\-7 disks.

.I sataphy[,reset]
\- [SATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints values
and descriptions of the SATA Phy Event Counters (General Purpose Log
address 0x11). If \'\-l sataphy,reset\' is specified, all counters
are reset after reading the values.

.I sasphy[,reset]
\- [SAS (SCSI) only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints values
and descriptions of the SAS (SSP) Protocol Specific log page (log page
0x18). If \'\-l sasphy,reset\' is specified, all counters
are reset after reading the values.

.I gplog,ADDR[,FIRST[\-LAST|+SIZE]]
\- [ATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints a hex dump
of any log accessible via General Purpose Logging (GPL) feature.
The log address ADDR is the hex address listed in the log directory
(see \'\-l directory\' above). The range of log sectors (pages) can
be specified by decimal values FIRST\-LAST or FIRST+SIZE. FIRST
defaults to 0, SIZE defaults to 1. LAST can be set to \'max\' to
specify the last page of the log.

.I smartlog,ADDR[,FIRST[\-LAST|+SIZE]]
\- [ATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints a hex dump
of any log accessible via SMART Read Log command. See
\'\-l gplog,...\' above for parameter syntax.

For example, all these commands:
.nf
  smartctl \-l gplog,0x80,10-15 /dev/sda
  smartctl \-l gplog,0x80,10+6 /dev/sda
  smartctl \-l smartlog,0x80,10-15 /dev/sda
.fi
print pages 10-15 of log 0x80 (first host vendor specific log).

The hex dump format is compatible with the \'xxd \-r\' command.
This command:
.nf
  smartctl \-l gplog,0x11 /dev/sda | grep ^0 | xxd -r >log.bin
.fi
writes a binary representation of the one sector log 0x11
(SATA Phy Event Counters) to file log.bin.

.TP
.B \-v ID,FORMAT[,NAME], \-\-vendorattribute=ID,FORMAT[,NAME]
[ATA only] Sets a vendor\-specific raw value print FORMAT and
optional NAME for Attribute ID.
This option may be used multiple times.

The Attribute ID can be in the range 1 to 255. If \'N\' is specified as
ID, the settings for all Attributes are changed. The NAME is a string of
letters, digits and underscore.

.I \-v help
\- Prints (to STDOUT) a list of all valid arguments to this option,
then exits.

Valid arguments for FORMAT are:

.I raw8
\- Print the Raw value as six 8\-bit unsigned base\-10 integers.
This may be useful for decoding the meaning of the Raw value.

.I raw16
\- Print the Raw value as three 16\-bit unsigned base\-10 integers.
This may be useful for decoding the meaning of the Raw value.

.I raw48
\- Print the Raw value as a 48\-bit unsigned base\-10 integer.
This is the default for most attributes.

.I hex48
\- Print the Raw value as a 12 digit hexadecimal number.
This may be useful for decoding the meaning of the Raw value.

.I raw64
\- Print the Raw value as a 64\-bit unsigned base\-10 integer.
This includes two bytes from the normalized and worst attribute value.
This new raw format is used by some recent SSD devices.

.I hex64
\- Print the Raw value as a 16 digit hexadecimal number.
This includes two bytes from the normalized and worst attribute value.
This new raw format is used by some recent SSD devices.

.I min2hour
\- Raw Attribute is power\-on time in minutes.  Its raw value
will be displayed in the form "Xh+Ym".  Here X is hours, and Y is
minutes in the range 0\-59 inclusive.  Y is always printed with two
digits, for example "06" or "31" or "00".

.I sec2hour
\- Raw Attribute is power\-on time in seconds.  Its raw value
will be displayed in the form "Xh+Ym+Zs".  Here X is hours, Y is
minutes in the range 0\-59 inclusive, and Z is seconds in the range
0\-59 inclusive.  Y and Z are always printed with two digits, for
example "06" or "31" or "00".

.I halfmin2hour
\- Raw Attribute is power\-on time, measured in units of 30
seconds.  This format is used by some Samsung disks.  Its raw value
will be displayed in the form "Xh+Ym".  Here X is hours, and Y is
minutes in the range 0\-59 inclusive.  Y is always printed with two
digits, for example "06" or "31" or "00".

.I tempminmax
\- Raw Attribute is the disk temperature in Celsius.  Info about
Lifetime Min/Max temperature is printed if available.  This is the
default for Attributes 190 and 194.

.I temp10x
\- Raw Attribute is ten times the disk temperature in Celsius.

.I raw16(raw16)
\- Print the raw attribute as a 16\-bit value and two optional
16\-bit values if these words are nonzero.  This is the default
for Attributes 5 and 196.

.I raw16(avg16)
\- Raw attribute is spin-up time.  It is printed as a 16-bit value
and an optional "Average" 16-bit value if the word is nonzero.
This is the default for Attribute 3.

.I raw24/raw24
\- Raw Attribute contains two 24\-bit values. The first is the
number of load cycles.  The second is the number of unload cycles.
The difference between these two values is the number of times that
the drive was unexpectedly powered off (also called an emergency
unload). As a rule of thumb, the mechanical stress created by one
emergency unload is equivalent to that created by one hundred normal
unloads.

The following old arguments to \'\-v\' are also still valid:

.I 9,minutes
\- same as:
.I 9,min2hour,Power_On_Minutes.

.I 9,seconds
\- same as:
.I 9,sec2hour,Power_On_Seconds.

.I 9,halfminutes
\- same as:
.I 9,halfmin2hour,Power_On_Half_Minutes.

.I 9,temp
\- same as:
.I 9,tempminmax,Temperature_Celsius.

.I 192,emergencyretractcyclect
\- same as:
.I 192,raw48,Emerg_Retract_Cycle_Ct

.I 193,loadunload
\- same as:
.I 193,raw24/raw24.

.I 194,10xCelsius
\- same as:
.I 194,temp10x,Temperature_Celsius_x10.

.I 194,unknown
\- same as:
.I 194,raw48,Unknown_Attribute.

.I 197,increasing
\- same as:
.I 197,raw48,Total_Pending_Sectors.
Also means that Attribute number 197 (Current Pending Sector Count)
is not reset if uncorrectable sectors are reallocated
(see \fBsmartd.conf\fP(5) man page).

.I 198,increasing
\- same as:
.I 198,raw48,Total_Offl_Uncorrectabl.
Also means that Attribute number 198 (Offline Uncorrectable Sector Count)
is not reset if uncorrectable sectors are reallocated
(see \fBsmartd.conf\fP(5) man page).

.I 198,offlinescanuncsectorct
\- same as:
.I 198,raw48,Offline_Scan_UNC_SectCt.

.TP
.B \-F TYPE, \-\-firmwarebug=TYPE
[ATA only] Modifies the behavior of \fBsmartctl\fP to compensate for some
known and understood device firmware or driver bug.  Except \'swapid\',
the arguments to this option are exclusive, so that only the final
option given is used.  The valid values are:

.I none
\- Assume that the device firmware obeys the ATA specifications.  This
is the default, unless the device has presets for \'\-F\' in the
device database (see note below).

.I samsung
\- In some Samsung disks (example: model SV4012H Firmware Version:
RM100\-08) some of the two\- and four\-byte quantities in the SMART data
structures are byte\-swapped (relative to the ATA specification).
Enabling this option tells \fBsmartctl\fP to evaluate these quantities
in byte\-reversed order.  Some signs that your disk needs this option
are (1) no self\-test log printed, even though you have run self\-tests;
(2) very large numbers of ATA errors reported in the ATA error log;
(3) strange and impossible values for the ATA error log timestamps.

.I samsung2
\- In more recent Samsung disks (firmware revisions ending in "\-23")
the number of ATA errors reported is byte swapped.  Enabling this
option tells \fBsmartctl\fP to evaluate this quantity in
byte\-reversed order. An indication that your Samsung disk needs this
option is that the self\-test log is printed correctly, but there are a
very large number of errors in the SMART error log.  This is because
the error count is byte swapped.  Thus a disk with five errors
(0x0005) will appear to have 20480 errors (0x5000).

.I samsung3
\- Some Samsung disks (at least SP2514N with Firmware VF100\-37) report
a self\-test still in progress with 0% remaining when the test was already
completed. Enabling this option modifies the output of the self\-test
execution status (see options \'\-c\' or \'\-a\' above) accordingly.

Note that an explicit \'\-F\' option on the command line will
over\-ride any preset values for \'\-F\' (see the \'\-P\' option
below).

.I swapid
\- Fixes byte swapped ATA identify strings (device name, serial number,
firmware version) returned by some buggy device drivers.

.TP
.B \-P TYPE, \-\-presets=TYPE
[ATA only] Specifies whether \fBsmartctl\fP should use any preset options
that are available for this drive. By default, if the drive is recognized
in the \fBsmartmontools\fP database, then the presets are used.

\fBsmartctl\fP can automatically set appropriate options for known
drives.  For example, the Maxtor 4D080H4 uses Attribute 9 to stores
power\-on time in minutes whereas most drives use that Attribute to
store the power\-on time in hours.  The command\-line option \'\-v
9,minutes\' ensures that \fBsmartctl\fP correctly interprets Attribute
9 in this case, but that option is preset for the Maxtor 4D080H4 and
so need not be specified by the user on the \fBsmartctl\fP command
line.

The argument
.I show
will show any preset options for your drive and the argument
.I showall
will show all known drives in the \fBsmartmontools\fP database, along
with their preset options.  If there are no presets for your drive and
you think there should be (for example, a \-v or \-F option is needed
to get \fBsmartctl\fP to display correct values) then please contact
the \fBsmartmontools\fP developers so that this information can be
added to the \fBsmartmontools\fP database.  Contact information is at the
end of this man page.

The valid arguments to this option are:

.I use
\- if a drive is recognized, then use the stored presets for it.  This
is the default. Note that presets will NOT over\-ride additional
Attribute interpretation (\'\-v N,something\') command\-line options or
explicit \'\-F\' command\-line options..

.I ignore
\- do not use presets.

.I show
\- show if the drive is recognized in the database, and if so, its
presets, then exit.

.I showall
\- list all recognized drives, and the presets that are set for them,
then exit.

The \'\-P showall\' option takes up to two optional arguments to
match a specific drive type and firmware version. The command:
.nf
  smartctl \-P showall
.fi
lists all entries, the command:
.nf
  smartctl \-P showall \'MODEL\'
.fi
lists all entries matching MODEL, and the command:
.nf
  smartctl \-P showall \'MODEL\' \'FIRMWARE\'
.fi
lists all entries for this MODEL and a specific FIRMWARE version.

.TP
.B \-B [+]FILE, \-\-drivedb=[+]FILE
[ATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] Read the drive database from
FILE.  The new database replaces the built in database by default. If \'+\' is
specified, then the new entries prepend the built in entries.

If this option is not specified, optional entries are read from the file
\fB/usr/local/etc/smart_drivedb.h\fP (Windows: \fB./smart_drivedb.conf\fP).
.\" BEGIN ENABLE_DRIVEDB
If \fB/usr/local/share/smartmontools/drivedb.h\fP is present, the
contents of this file is used instead of the built in table.
.\" END ENABLE_DRIVEDB

The database files use the same C/C++ syntax that is used to initialize
the built in database array. C/C++ style comments are allowed.
Example:

.nf
  /* Full entry: */
  {
    "Model family",    // Info about model family/series.
    "MODEL1.*REGEX",   // Regular expression to match model of device.
    "VERSION.*REGEX",  // Regular expression to match firmware version(s).
    "Some warning",    // Warning message.
    "\-v 9,minutes"     // String of preset \-v and \-F options.
  },
  /* Minimal entry: */
  {
    "",                // No model family/series info.
    "MODEL2.*REGEX",   // Regular expression to match model of device.
    "",                // All firmware versions.
    "",                // No warning.
    ""                 // No options preset.
  },
  /* ... */
.fi

.TP
.B SMART RUN/ABORT OFFLINE TEST AND SELF\-TEST OPTIONS:
.TP
.B \-t TEST, \-\-test=TEST
Executes TEST immediately.  The \'\-C\' option can be used in
conjunction with this option to run the short or long (and also for
ATA devices, selective or conveyance) self\-tests in captive mode
(known as "foreground mode" for SCSI devices).  Note that only one
test type can be run at a time, so only one test type should be
specified per command line.  Note also that if a computer is shutdown
or power cycled during a self\-test, no harm should result.  The
self\-test will either be aborted or will resume automatically.

The valid arguments to this option are:  

.I offline
\- runs SMART Immediate Offline Test.  This immediately
starts the test described above.  This command can be given during
normal system operation.  The effects of this test are visible only in
that it updates the SMART Attribute values, and if errors are
found they will appear in the SMART error log, visible with the \'\-l error\'
option. [In the case of SCSI devices runs the default self test in
foreground. No entry is placed in the self test log.]

If the \'\-c\' option to \fBsmartctl\fP shows that the device has the
"Suspend Offline collection upon new command" capability then you can
track the progress of the Immediate Offline test using the \'\-c\'
option to \fBsmartctl\fP.  If the \'\-c\' option show that the device
has the "Abort Offline collection upon new command" capability then
most commands will abort the Immediate Offline Test, so you should not
try to track the progress of the test with \'\-c\', as it will abort
the test.

.I short
\- runs SMART Short Self Test (usually under ten minutes).
[Note: in the case of SCSI devices,
this command option runs the "Background short" self\-test.]
This command can be given during normal system operation (unless run in
captive mode \- see the \'\-C\' option below).  This is a
test in a different category than the immediate or automatic offline
tests.  The "Self" tests check the electrical and mechanical
performance as well as the read performance of the disk.  Their
results are reported in the Self Test Error Log, readable with
the \'\-l selftest\' option.  Note that on some disks the progress of the
self\-test can be monitored by watching this log during the self\-test; with other disks
use the \'\-c\' option to monitor progress.

.I long
\- runs SMART Extended Self Test (tens of minutes).
[Note: in the case of SCSI devices,
this command option runs the "Background long" self\-test.]
This is a
longer and more thorough version of the Short Self Test described
above.  Note that this command can be given during normal
system operation (unless run in captive mode \- see the \'\-C\' option below).

.I conveyance
\- [ATA only] runs a SMART Conveyance Self Test (minutes).  This
self\-test routine is intended to identify damage incurred during
transporting of the device. This self\-test routine should take on the
order of minutes to complete.  Note that this command can be given
during normal system operation (unless run in captive mode \- see the
\'\-C\' option below).

.I select,N\-M, select,N+SIZE
\- [ATA only] runs a SMART Selective Self Test, to test a \fBrange\fP
of disk Logical Block Addresses (LBAs), rather than the entire disk.
Each range of LBAs that is checked is called a "span" and is specified
by a starting LBA (N) and an ending LBA (M) with N less than or equal
to M. The range can also be specified as N+SIZE. A span at the end of
a disk can be specified by N\-\fBmax\fP.

For example the commands:
.nf
  smartctl \-t select,10\-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,10+11 /dev/hda
.fi
both runs a self test on one span consisting of LBAs ten to twenty
(inclusive). The command:
.nf
  smartctl \-t select,100000000\-max /dev/hda
.fi
run a self test from LBA 100000000 up to the end of the disk.
The \'\-t\' option can be given up to five times, to test
up to five spans.  For example the command:
.nf
  smartctl \-t select,0\-100 \-t select,1000\-2000 /dev/hda
.fi
runs a self test on two spans.  The first span consists of 101 LBAs
and the second span consists of 1001 LBAs.  Note that the spans can
overlap partially or completely, for example:
.nf
  smartctl \-t select,0\-10 \-t select,5\-15 \-t select,10\-20 /dev/hda
.fi
The results of the selective self\-test can be obtained (both during
and after the test) by printing the SMART self\-test log, using the
\'\-l selftest\' option to smartctl.

Selective self tests are particularly useful as disk capacities
increase: an extended self test (smartctl \-t long) can take several
hours.  Selective self\-tests are helpful if (based on SYSLOG error
messages, previous failed self\-tests, or SMART error log entries) you
suspect that a disk is having problems at a particular range of
Logical Block Addresses (LBAs).

Selective self\-tests can be run during normal system operation (unless
done in captive mode \- see the \'\-C\' option below).

[Note: To use this feature on Linux, the kernel must be compiled with
the configuration option CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO enabled.  Please report
unusual or incorrect behavior to the smartmontools\-support mailing list.]

The following variants of the selective self\-test command use spans based
on the ranges from past tests already stored on the disk:

.I select,redo[+SIZE]
\- [ATA only] redo the last SMART Selective Self Test using the same LBA
range. The starting LBA is identical to the LBA used by last test, same
for ending LBA unless a new span size is specified by optional +SIZE
argument.

For example the commands:
.nf
  smartctl \-t select,10\-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,redo /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,redo+20 /dev/hda
.fi
have the same effect as:
.nf
  smartctl \-t select,10\-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,10\-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,10\-29 /dev/hda
.fi

.I select,next[+SIZE]
\- [ATA only] runs a SMART Selective Self Test on the LBA range which
follows the range of the last test. The starting LBA is set to (ending
LBA +1) of the last test. A new span size may be specified by the
optional +SIZE argument.

For example the commands:
.nf
  smartctl \-t select,0\-999 /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,next /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,next+2000 /dev/hda
.fi
have the same effect as:
.nf
  smartctl \-t select,0\-999 /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,1000\-1999 /dev/hda
  smartctl \-t select,2000\-3999 /dev/hda
.fi

If the last test ended at the last LBA of the disk, the new range starts
at LBA 0. The span size of the last span of a disk is adjusted such that
the total number of spans to check the full disk will not be changed
by future uses of \'\-t select,next\'.

.I select,cont[+SIZE]
\- [ATA only] performs a \'redo\' (above) if the self test status reports
that the last test was aborted by the host. Otherwise it run the \'next\'
(above) test.

.I afterselect,on
\- [ATA only] perform an offline read scan after a Selective Self\-test
has completed. This option must be used together with one or more of
the \fIselect,N\-M\fP options above. If the LBAs that have been
specified in the Selective self\-test pass the test with no errors
found, then read scan the \fBremainder\fP of the disk.  If the device
is powered\-cycled while this read scan is in progress, the read scan
will be automatically resumed after a time specified by the pending
timer (see below).  The value of this option is preserved between
selective self\-tests.

.I afterselect,off
\- [ATA only] do not read scan the remainder of the disk after a
Selective self\-test has completed.  This option must be use together
with one or more of the \fIselect,N\-M\fP options above.  The value of this
option is preserved between selective self\-tests.

.I pending,N 
\- [ATA only] set the pending offline read scan timer to N minutes.
Here N is an integer in the range from 0 to 65535 inclusive.  If the
device is powered off during a read scan after a Selective self\-test,
then resume the test automatically N minutes after power\-up.  This
option must be use together with one or more of the \fIselect,N\-M\fP
options above. The value of this option is preserved between selective
self\-tests.

.I scttempint,N[,p]
\- [ATA only] set the time interval for SCT temperature logging to N
minutes. If \',p\' is specified, the setting is preserved across power
cycles. Otherwise, the setting is volatile and will be reverted to
default (1 minute), or last non-volatile setting by the next hard reset.
This command also clears the temperature history table. See
\'\-l scttemp\' above for more information about SCT temperature logging.

.TP
.B \-C, \-\-captive
Runs self\-tests in captive mode.  This has no effect with \'\-t
offline\' or if the \'\-t\' option is not used. [Note: in the case of
SCSI devices, this command option runs the self\-test in "Foreground"
mode.]

\fBWARNING: Tests run in captive mode may busy out the drive for the
length of the test.  Only run captive tests on drives without any
mounted partitions!\fP

.TP
.B \-X, \-\-abort
Aborts non\-captive SMART Self Tests.  Note that this
command will abort the Offline Immediate Test routine only if your
disk has the "Abort Offline collection upon new command" capability.
.PP
.SH ATA, SCSI command sets and SAT
In the past there has been a clear distinction between storage devices
that used the ATA and SCSI command sets. This distinction was often
reflected in their device naming and hardware. Now various SCSI
transports (e.g. SAS, FC and iSCSI) can interconnect to both SCSI
disks (e.g. FC and SAS) and ATA disks (especially SATA). USB and
IEEE 1394 storage devices use the SCSI command set externally but
almost always contain ATA or SATA disks (or flash). The storage
subsystems in some operating systems have started to remove the
distinction between ATA and SCSI in their device naming policies.
.PP
99% of operations that an OS performs on a disk involve the SCSI INQUIRY,
READ CAPACITY, READ and WRITE commands, or their ATA equivalents. Since
the SCSI commands are slightly more general than their ATA equivalents,
many OSes are generating SCSI commands (mainly READ and WRITE) and
letting a lower level translate them to their ATA equivalents as the
need arises. An important note here is that "lower level" may be in
external equipment and hence outside the control of an OS.
.PP
SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) is a standard (ANSI INCITS 431-2007) that
specifies how this translation is done. For the other 1% of operations
that an OS performs on a disk, SAT provides two options. First is an
optional ATA PASS-THROUGH SCSI command (there are two variants). The
second is a translation from the closest SCSI command. Most current
interest is in the "pass-through" option.
.PP
The relevance to smartmontools (and hence smartctl) is that its
interactions with disks fall solidly into the "1%" category. So even
if the OS can happily treat (and name) a disk as "SCSI", smartmontools
needs to detect the native command set and act accordingly.
As more storage manufacturers (including external SATA drives) comply
with SAT, smartmontools is able to automatically distinguish the native
command set of the device. In some cases the '\-d sat' option is needed
on the command line.
.PP
There are also virtual disks which typically have no useful information
to convey to smartmontools, but could conceivably in the future. An
example of a virtual disk is the OS's view of a RAID 1 box. There are
most likely two SATA disks inside a RAID 1 box. Addressing those SATA
disks from a distant OS is a challenge for smartmontools. Another
approach is running a tool like smartmontools inside the RAID 1 box (e.g.
a Network Attached Storage (NAS) box) and fetching the logs via a
browser. 
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.B smartctl \-a /dev/hda
.fi
Print a large amount of SMART information for drive /dev/hda which is
typically an ATA (IDE) or SATA disk in Linux.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-a /dev/sdb
.fi
Print a large amount of SMART information for drive /dev/sda . This may
be a SCSI disk or an ATA (SATA) disk.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-s off /dev/hdd
.fi
Disable SMART monitoring and data log collection on drive /dev/hdd .
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-\-smart=on \-\-offlineauto=on \-\-saveauto=on /dev/hda
.fi
Enable SMART on drive /dev/hda, enable automatic offline
testing every four hours, and enable autosaving of
SMART Attributes.  This is a good start\-up line for your system\'s
init files.  You can issue this command on a running system.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-t long /dev/hdc
.fi
Begin an extended self\-test of drive /dev/hdc.  You can issue this
command on a running system.  The results can be seen in the self\-test
log visible with the \'\-l selftest\' option after it has completed.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-s on \-t offline /dev/hda
.fi
Enable SMART on the disk, and begin an immediate offline test of
drive /dev/hda.  You can issue this command on a running system.  The
results are only used to update the SMART Attributes, visible
with the \'\-A\' option.  If any device errors occur, they are logged to
the SMART error log, which can be seen with the \'\-l error\' option.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-A \-v 9,minutes /dev/hda
.fi
Shows the vendor Attributes, when the disk stores its power\-on time
internally in minutes rather than hours.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-q errorsonly \-H \-l selftest /dev/hda
.fi
Produces output only if the device returns failing SMART status,
or if some of the logged self\-tests ended with errors.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-q silent \-a /dev/hda
.fi
Examine all SMART data for device /dev/hda, but produce no
printed output.  You must use the exit status (the
.B $?
shell variable) to learn if any Attributes are out of bound, if the
SMART status is failing, if there are errors recorded in the
self\-test log, or if there are errors recorded in the disk error log.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-a \-d 3ware,0 /dev/sda
.fi
Examine all SMART data for the first ATA disk connected to a 3ware
RAID controller card.

.nf
.B smartctl \-t short \-d 3ware,3 /dev/sdb
.fi
Start a short self\-test on the fourth ATA disk connected to the 3ware RAID
controller card which is the second SCSI device /dev/sdb.
.PP
.nf

first HighPoint RocketRAID controller card.
.nf
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-t short \-d hpt,1/1/2 /dev/sda    (under Linux)
.B smartctl \-t short \-d hpt,1/1/2 /dev/hptrr    (under FreeBSD)
.fi
Start a short self\-test on the (S)ATA disk connected to second pmport on the
first channel of the first HighPoint RocketRAID controller card.
.PP
.nf

.fi
Run a selective self\-test on LBAs 10 to 100 and 30 to 300.  After the
these LBAs have been tested, read\-scan the remainder of the disk.  If the disk is
power\-cycled during the read\-scan, resume the scan 45 minutes after power to the
device is restored.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-a \-d cciss,0 /dev/cciss/c0d0
.fi
Examine all SMART data for the first SCSI disk connected to a cciss
RAID controller card.
.PP
.SH RETURN VALUES
The return values of \fBsmartctl\fP are defined by a bitmask.  If all
is well with the disk, the return value (exit status) of
\fBsmartctl\fP is 0 (all bits turned off).  If a problem occurs, or an
error, potential error, or fault is detected, then a non\-zero status
is returned.  In this case, the eight different bits in the return
value have the following meanings for ATA disks; some of these values
may also be returned for SCSI disks.
.TP
.B Bit 0:
Command line did not parse.
.TP
.B Bit 1:
Device open failed, or device did not return an IDENTIFY DEVICE structure. 
.TP
.B Bit 2:
Some SMART command to the disk failed, or there was a checksum error
in a SMART data structure (see \'\-b\' option above).
.TP
.B Bit 3:
SMART status check returned "DISK FAILING".
.TP
.B Bit 4:
We found prefail Attributes <= threshold.
.TP
.B Bit 5:
SMART status check returned "DISK OK" but we found that some (usage
or prefail) Attributes have been <= threshold at some time in the
past. 
.TP
.B Bit 6:
The device error log contains records of errors.
.TP
.B Bit 7:
The device self\-test log contains records of errors.

To test within the shell for whether or not the different bits are
turned on or off, you can use the following type of construction (this
is bash syntax):
.nf
.B smartstat=$(($? & 8))
.fi
This looks at only at bit 3 of the exit status
.B $?
(since 8=2^3).  The shell variable
$smartstat will be nonzero if SMART status check returned "disk
failing" and zero otherwise.

.PP
.SH NOTES
The TapeAlert log page flags are cleared for the initiator when the
page is read. This means that each alert condition is reported only
once by \fBsmartctl\fP for each initiator for each activation of the
condition.

An introductory article about smartmontools is \fIMonitoring Hard
Disks with SMART\fP, by Bruce Allen, Linux Journal, January 2004,
pages 74\-77. This is \fBhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6983\fP
online.

If you would like to understand better how SMART works, and what it
does, a good place to start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first
volume of the \'AT Attachment with Packet Interface\-7\' (ATA/ATAPI\-7)
specification.  This documents the SMART functionality which the
\fBsmartmontools\fP utilities provide access to.  You can find
Revision 4b of this document at
