.TH SMARTCTL 8  "$Date: 2003/02/24 15:51:37 $" "smartmontools-5.1"
.SH NAME
smartctl \- S.M.A.R.T. control and monitor utility 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smartctl [options] device

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B smartctl
controls the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology
(S.M.A.R.T.) system built into many ATA-3 and later ATA, IDE and
SCSI-3 hard drives. The purpose of S.M.A.R.T. is to monitor the
reliability of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry
out different types of drive self-tests.  This version of smartctl is
compatible with ATA/ATAPI-5 and earlier standards (see REFERENCES
below)

.B smartctl
is a command line utility designed to perform S.M.A.R.T. tasks such as
printing the S.M.A.R.T. self-test and error logs, and enabling and
disabling S.M.A.R.T. automatic testing. Note: if the user issues a
S.M.A.R.T. command that is (apparently) not implemented by the device,
.B smartctl
will print a warning message but issue the command anyway.  This should
not cause problems: unimplemented S.M.A.R.T. commands issued to a
drive are ignored and return an error.

.B smartctl
also provides limited TapeAlerts support for some SCSI tape drives and
changers.

The user must specify the device to be controlled or interrogated as the final
argument to
.B smartctl.
ATA devices use the form "/dev/hd*" and SCSI devices use the form "/dev/sd*".
For SCSI Tape Drives and Changers with TapeAlerts support use the devices
"/dev/st*" and "/dev/sg*".  More general paths may also be specified.
.B smartctl
will attempt to guess the device type, but the '\-d' option can be used to
specify a device type of ATA or SCSI if required.

Note that the printed output of
.B smartctl
displays most numerical values in base 10 (decimal), but some values
are displayed in base 16 (hexidecimal).  To distinguish them, the base
16 values are always displayed with a leading
.B "0x"
for example: "0xff". This convention is also followed in this man
page.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options are grouped below into several categories.
.B smartctl
will execute the corresponding commands in the order: INFORMATION,
ENABLE/DISABLE, DISPLAY DATA, RUN/ABORT TESTS.

SCSI devices only accept the options 
.B \-h, \-?, \-V, \-i, \-a, \-d, \-s, \-H, \-t, \-C \-l selftest
and 
.B \-X. 
TapeAlerts devices only accept the options 
.B \-h, \-?, \-V, \-i, \-a, \-d, \-s
and 
.B \-H.

Long options  are  not  supported  on  all  systems.   Use
.B 'smartctl \-h'
to see the available options.

.TP
.B SHOW INFORMATION:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help, \-\-usage
Prints a usage message to STDOUT and exits.
.TP
.B \-?
Same as
.B \-h.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version, \-\-copyright, \-\-license
Prints version, copyright, license, home page and CVS-id information for your
copy of
.B smartctl
to STDOUT and then exits.  Please include this information if you are
reporting bugs or problems.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-info
Prints the disk model number, serial number, firmware version, and ATA Standard
version/revision information.  Says if the device supports S.M.A.R.T., and if
so, whether S.M.A.R.T. support is currently enabled or disabled.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
Prints all S.M.A.R.T. information about the disk.  This is equivalent to '\-H
\-i \-c \-A \-l error \-l selftest' (for SCSI, '\-H \-i \-l selftest').
.TP
.B RUN-TIME BEHAVIOR:
.TP
.B \-q TYPE, \-\-quietmode=TYPE
Specifies that
.B smartctl
should run in one of the two quiet modes described here.  The valid arguments
to this option are:

.I errorsonly
\- only print: For the '\-l error' option, if nonzero, the number
of errors recorded in the SMART error log and the power-on time when
they occurred; For the '\-l selftest' option, errors recorded in the device
self-test log; For the '\-H' option, SMART "disk failing" status or device
Attributes (pre-failure or usage) which failed either now or in the
past; For the '\-A' option, device Attributes (pre-failure or usage)
which failed either now or in the past.

.I silent
\- print no output.  The only way to learn about what was
found is to use the exit status of
.B smartctl
(see RETURN VALUES below).
.TP
.B \-d TYPE, \-\-device=TYPE
Specifies the type of the device.  The valid arguments to this option
are \fIata\fP and \fIscsi\fP.  If this option is not used then
.B smartctl
will attempt to guess the device type from the device name.
.TP
.B \-T TYPE, \-\-tolerance=TYPE
Specifies how tolerant
.B smartctl
should be of S.M.A.R.T. command failures.  The valid arguments to this option
are:

.I normal
\- exit on failure of a mandatory S.M.A.R.T. command, but not on failure of an
optional S.M.A.R.T. command.  This is the default.  

.I conservative
\- exit on failure of any S.M.A.R.T. command.

.I permissive
\- ignore failure of any S.M.A.R.T. command.

Here "mandatory" means "required by the ATA/ATAPI-5 Specification if the
device implements the S.M.A.R.T. command set" and "optional" means "not
required by the ATA/ATAPI-5 Specification even if the device implements
the S.M.A.R.T. command set."  The 'mandatory' S.M.A.R.T. commands are: (1)
Enable/Disable Attribute Autosave, (2) Enable/Disable S.M.A.R.T., and (3)
S.M.A.R.T. Return Status.

.TP
.B \-b TYPE, \-\-badsum=TYPE
Specifies the action 
.B smartctl
should take if a checksum error is detected in the: (1) Device
Identity Structure, (2) S.M.A.R.T. Self-Test Log Structure, (3)
S.M.A.R.T. Attribute Value Structure, (4) S.M.A.R.T. Attribute
Threshold Structure, or (5) ATA Error Log Structure.

The valid arguments to this option are:

.I warn
\- report the incorrect checksum but carry on in spite of it.  This is the
default.

.I exit
\- exit
.B smartctl.

.I ignore
\- continue silently without issuing a warning.

.TP
.B S.M.A.R.T. FEATURE ENABLE/DISABLE COMMANDS:
.IP
.B Note: 
if multiple options are used to both enable and disable a
feature, then 
.B both
the enable and disable commands will be issued.  The enable command
will always be issued
.B before
the corresponding disable command.
.TP
.B \-s VALUE, \-\-smart=VALUE 
Enables or disables S.M.A.R.T. on device.  The valid arguments to
this option are \fIon\fP and \fIoff\fP.  Note that the command '\-s on'
(perhaps used with with the '\-o on' and '\-S on' options) should be placed
in a start-up script for your machine, for example in rc.local or rc.sysinit.
In principle the S.M.A.R.T. feature settings are preserved over
power-cycling, but it doesn't hurt to be sure.
.TP
.B \-o VALUE, \-\-offlineauto=VALUE
Enables or disables S.M.A.R.T. automatic offline test, which scans the drive
every four hours for disk defects. This command can be given during normal
system operation.  The valid arguments to this option are \fIon\fP
and \fIoff\fP.

Note that the S.M.A.R.T. automatic offline test command is listed as 'Obsolete'
in every version of the ATA and ATA/ATAPI Specifications
that I can find.  However it is implemented and used by some
vendors. [Good documentation can be found in IBM's Official
Published Disk Specifications.  For example the IBM Travelstar 40GNX
Hard Disk Drive Specifications (Revision 1.1, 22 April 2002,
Publication # 1541, Document S07N-7715-02) page 164.]

S.M.A.R.T. provides
.B three basic categories of testing.
The 
.B first category,
called 'online' testing, has no effect on the performance of
the device.  It is turned on by the '\-s on' option.

The 
.B second category of testing
is called 'offline' testing. This type
of test can, in principle, degrade the device performance.  The '\-o on'
option causes this offline testing to be carried out, automatically,
on a regular scheduled basis.  Normally, the disk will suspend
offline testing while disk accesses are taking place, and then
automatically resume it when the disk would otherwise be idle, so in
practice it has little effect.  Note that a one-time offline test can
also be carried out immediately upon receipt of a user command.  See
the '\-t offline' option below, which causes a one-time offline test to be
carried out immediately.

Any errors detected in automatic or immediate offline testing are
reflected in the values of the S.M.A.R.T. Attributes; some types of
errors may also appear in the S.M.A.R.T. error log. These are visible
with the '\-A' and '\-l error' options respectively.

The 
.B third category of testing
is the 'self' testing.  This third type of
test is only performed (immediately) when a command to run it is
issued.  The '\-t' and '\-X' options can be used to carry out and abort such
self-tests; please see below for further details.

Any errors detected in the self testing will be shown in the
S.M.A.R.T. self-test log, which can be examined using the '\-l selftest'
option.

.B Note:
in this manual page, the word 
.B "Test"
is used in connection with the second category 
just described, e.g. for the 'offline' testing.  The words 
.B "Self-test"
are used in connection with the third category.
.TP
.B \-S VALUE, \-\-saveauto=VALUE
Enables or disables S.M.A.R.T. autosave of device vendor-specific
Attributes. The valid arguments to this option are \fIon\fP
and \fIoff\fP.  Note that this feature is preserved across disk power
cycles, so you should only need to issue it once.
.TP
.B S.M.A.R.T. READ AND DISPLAY DATA OPTIONS:
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-health
Check: Ask the device to report its S.M.A.R.T. health status.  It does
this using information that it has gathered from online and offline
tests, which were used to determine/update its
S.M.A.R.T. vendor-specific Attribute values.

If the device reports failing health status, this means
.B either
that the device has already failed, 
.B or 
that it is predicting its own failure within the next 24 hours.  If
this happens, use the '\-a' option to get more information, and
.B get your data off the disk and someplace safe as soon as you can.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-capabilities
Prints only the generic S.M.A.R.T. capabilities.  These show
what S.M.A.R.T. features are implemented and how the device will
respond to some of the different S.M.A.R.T. commands.  For example it
shows if the device logs errors, if it supports offline surface
scanning, and so on.  If the device can carry out self-tests, this
option also shows the estimated time required to run those tests.

Note that the time required to run the Self-tests (listed in minutes)
are fixed.  However the time required to run the Immediate Offline
Test (listed in seconds) is variable.  This means that if you issue a
command to perform an Immediate Offline test with the '\-t offline' option,
then the time may jump to a larger value and then count down as the
Immediate Offline Test is carried out.  Please see REFERENCES below
for further information about the the flags and capabilities described
by this option.
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-attributes
Prints only the vendor specific S.M.A.R.T. Attributes.  The
Attributes are numbered from 1 to 253 and have specific names. For
example Attribute 12 is 'power cycle count': how many times has the
disk been powered up.

Each Attribute has a 'Raw' value, printed under the heading 'RAW_VALUE',
and a 'Normalized' value printed under the heading 'VALUE'.  [Note:
.B smartctl
prints these values in base-10.]  In the example just given, the 'Raw
Value' for Attribute 12 would be the actual number of times that the
disk has been power-cycled, for example 365 if the disk has been
turned on once per day for exactly one year.  Each vendor uses their
own algorithm to convert this Raw value to a Normalized value in the
range from 1 to 254.  Note that
.B smartctl
only reports the different Attribute values and thresholds.  It does
.B not
carry out the conversion between 'Raw' and 'Normalized' values.

Note that the conversion from 'Raw' value to a quantity with physical
units is not specified by the S.M.A.R.T. standard. In most cases, the
values printed by
.B smartctl
are sensible.  For example the temperature Attribute generally has its
raw value equal to the temperature in Celsius.  However in some cases
vendors use unusual conventions.  For example the Hitachi disk on my
laptop reports its power-on hours in minutes, not hours. Some IBM
disks track three temperatures rather than one, in their raw values.
And so on.

Each Attribute also has a Threshold value (whose range is 0 to 255)
which is printed under the heading 'THRESH'.  If the Normalized value
is
.B less than or equal to
the Threshold value, then the Attribute is said to have failed.  If
the Attribute is a pre-failure Attribute, then disk failure is
imminent.

Each Attribute also has a 'Worst' value shown under the heading 'WORST'.
This is the smallest (closest to failure) value that the
disk has recorded at any time during its lifetime when S.M.A.R.T.  was
enabled.  [Note however that some vendors will have firmware which will
.B increase
the 'Worst' value for some "rate-type" Attributes.]

The Attribute table printed out by 
.B smartctl
also shows the 'Type' of the Attribute.  Pre-failure Attributes are
ones which, if less than or equal to their threshold values, indicate
pending disk failure.  Old age, or usage Attributes, are ones which
indicate end-of-product life from old-age or normal aging and wearout,
if the Attribute value is less than or equal to the threshold.

If the Attribute's current Normalized value is <= threshold, then the 'Ever
failed' column will display 'FAILED NOW!'.  If not, but the worst
recorded value is <= threshold, then this column will display 'In the
past'.

So to summarize: the 'Raw' values are the ones that might have a real
physical interpretation, such as 'Temperature Celsius', 'Hours', or 'Start-Stop Cycles'.  
Each manufacturer converts these, using their
detailed knowledge of the disk's operations and failure modes, to
Normalized Attribute values in the range 1-254.  The worst (lowest
measured) of these Normalized Attribute values is stored on the disk,
along with a Threshold value that the manufacturer has determined will
indicate that the disk is going to fail, or that it has exceeded its
design age or aging limit.
.B smartctl
does not calculate any of these values, it merely reports them from
the S.M.A.R.T. data on the disk.

Note that starting with ATA/ATAPI-4, revision 4, the meaning of these
Attribute fields has been made entirely vendor-specific.  However most
ATA/ATAPI-5 disks seem to respect their meaning, so we have retained
the option of printing the Attribute values.
.TP
.B \-l TYPE, \-\-log=TYPE
Prints either the S.M.A.R.T. error log or the S.M.A.R.T. self-test log.  The
valid arguments to this option are:

.I error
\- prints only the S.M.A.R.T. error log.  S.M.A.R.T. disks maintain
a log of the most recent five non-trivial errors.  For each of these
errors, the disk power-on lifetime at which the error occurred is
recorded, as is the device status (idle, standby, etc) at the time of
the error.  Finally, up to the last five commands that preceded the
error are also recorded, along with a timestamp measured in seconds
from when the disk was powered up during the session where the error
took place.  [Note: this time stamp wraps after 2^32 milliseconds, or
49 days 17 hours 2 minutes and 47.296 seconds.]
The key ATA disk registers are also recorded in the log.

.I selftest
\- prints only the S.M.A.R.T. self-test log.  The disk maintains a log
showing the results of the self tests, which can be run using the
\'\-t' option described below.  For each of the most recent twenty-one
self-tests, the log shows the type of test (short or extended,
off-line or captive) and the final status of the test.  If the test
did not complete successfully, then the percentage of the test
remaining is shown.  The time at which the test took place, measured
in hours of disk lifetime, is also printed.  If any errors were
detected, the Logical Block Address (LBA) of the first error is
printed in hexadecimal notation.

.I selftest [SCSI]
\- the self-test log for a SCSI device has a slightly different format
than for an ATA device.  For each of the most recent twenty
self-tests, it shows the type of test and the status (final or in
progress) of the test. SCSI standards use the terms 'foreground' and
\'background' (rather than ATA's corresponding 'captive' and
\'off-line') and \'short' and 'long' (rather than ATA's corresponding
\'short' and 'extended') to describe the type of the test.  The printed
segment number is only relevant when a test fails in the third or
later test segment.  It identifies the test that failed and consists
of either the number of the segment that failed during the test, or
the number of the test that failed and the number of the segment in
which the test was run, using a vendor-specific method of putting both
numbers into a single byte.  The Logical Block Address (LBA) of the
first error is printed in hexadecimal notation. If provided, the SCSI
Sense Key (SK), Additional Sense Code (ASC) and Additional Sense Code
Qualifier (ASQ) are also printed. The self tests can be run using the
\'\-t' option described below (using the ATA test terminology).

.TP
.B \-v N,OPTION, \-\-vendorattribute=N,OPTION
Sets a vendor-specific display OPTION for Attribute N.  Valid
arguments to this option are:

.I help
\- Prints (to STDOUT) a list of all valid arguments to this option,
then exits.

.I 9,minutes
\- Raw Attribute number 9 is power-on time in minutes.  Its raw value
will be displayed in the form 'Xh+Ym'.  Here X is hours, and Y is
minutes in the range 0-59 inclusive.  Y is always printed with two
digits, for example \'06' or \'31' or '00'.

.I 9,seconds
\- Raw Attribute number 9 is power-on time in seconds.  Its raw value
will be displayed in the form 'Xh+Ym+Zs'.  Here X is hours, Y is
minutes in the range 0-59 inclusive, and Z is seconds in the range
0-59 inclusive.  Y and Z are always printed with two digits, for
example \'06' or \'31' or '00'.

.I 9,temp
\- Raw Attribute number 9 is the disk temperature in Celsius.

.I 220,temp
\- Raw Attribute number 220 is the disk temperature in Celsius.

A table of hard drive models, listing which Attribute corresponds to
temperature, can be found at: http://coredump.free.fr/linux/hddtemp.db

.TP
.B S.M.A.R.T. RUN/ABORT OFFLINE TEST AND SELF-TEST OPTIONS:
.TP
.B \-t TEST, \-\-test=TEST
Executes TEST immediately.  The '\-C' option can be used in
conjunction with this option to run the short or long self-tests in
captive mode (known as 'foreground mode' for SCSI devices).  Note that
only one test can be run at a time, so this option should only be used
once per command line.

The valid arguments to this option are:  

.I offline
\- runs S.M.A.R.T. Immediate Offline Test.  This immediately
starts the test described above.  This command can be given during
normal system operation.  The effects of this test are visible only in
that it updates the S.M.A.R.T. Attribute values, and if errors are
found they will appear in the S.M.A.R.T. error log, visible with the '\-l error'
option.  

If the '\-c' option to
.B smartctl
shows that the device has the "Suspend Offline collection upon new
command" capability then you can track the progress of the Immediate Offline
test using the '\-c' option to
.B smartctl.
If the '\-c' option show that the device has the "Abort Offline
collection upon new command" capability then most commands will abort
the Immediate Offline Test, so you should not try to track the
progress of the test with '\-c', as it will abort the test.

.I short
\- runs S.M.A.R.T. Short Self Test (usually under ten minutes).
[Note: in the case of SCSI devices,
this command option runs the 'Background short' self-test.]
This command can be given during normal system operation (unless run in
captive mode \- see the '\-C' option below).  This is a
test in a different category than the immediate or automatic offline
tests.  The 'Self' tests check the electrical and mechanical
performance as well as the read performance of the disk.  Their
results are reported in the Self Test Error Log, readable with
the '\-l selftest' option.  Note that on some disks the progress of the
self-test can be monitored by watching this log during the self-test; with other disks
use the '\-c' option to monitor progress.

.I long
\- runs S.M.A.R.T. Extended Self Test (tens of minutes).
[Note: in the case of SCSI devices,
this command option runs the 'Background long' self-test.]
This is a
longer and more thorough version of the Short Self Test described
above.  Note that this command can be given during normal
system operation (unless run in captive mode \- see the '\-C' option below).

.TP
.B \-C, \-\-captive
With '\-t short' or '\-t long', runs the self-test in captive mode.  This has
no effect with '\-t offline' or if the '\-t' option is not used. [Note: in the case
of SCSI devices, this command option runs the self-test in 'Foreground' mode.]

.B WARNING: Tests run in captive mode may busy out the drive for the length
.B of the test.  Only run captive tests on drives without any mounted partitions!

.TP
.B \-X, \-\-abort
Aborts non-captive S.M.A.R.T. Self Tests.  Note that this
command will abort the Offline Immediate Test routine only if your
disk has the "Abort Offline collection upon new command" capability.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.B smartctl \-a /dev/hda
.fi
Print all S.M.A.R.T. information for drive /dev/hda (Primary Master).
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-s off /dev/hdd
.fi
Disable S.M.A.R.T. on drive /dev/hdd (Secondary Slave).
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-\-smart=on \-\-offlineauto=on \-\-saveauto=on /dev/hda
.fi
Enable S.M.A.R.T. on drive /dev/hda, enable automatic offline
testing every four hours, and enable autosaving of
S.M.A.R.T. Attributes.  This is a good start-up line for your system's
init files.  You can issue this command on a running system.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-t long /dev/hdc
.fi
Begin an extended self-test of drive /dev/hdc.  You can issue this
command on a running system.  The results can be seen in the self-test
log visible with the '\-l selftest' option after it has completed.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-s on \-t offline /dev/hda
.fi
Enable S.M.A.R.T. on the disk, and begin an immediate offline test of
drive /dev/hda.  You can issue this command on a running system.  The
results are only used to update the S.M.A.R.T. Attributes, visible
with the '\-A' option.  If any device errors occur, they are logged to
the S.M.A.R.T. error log, which can be seen with the '\-l error' option.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-A \-v 9,minutes /dev/hda
.fi
Shows the vendor Attributes, when the disk stores its power-on time
internally in minutes rather than hours.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-q errorsonly \-H \-l selftest /dev/hda
.fi
Produces output only if the device returns failing S.M.A.R.T. status,
or if some of the logged self-tests ended with errors.
.PP
.nf
.B smartctl \-q silent \-a /dev/hda
.fi
Examine all S.M.A.R.T. data for device /dev/hda, but produce no
printed output.  You must use the exit status (the
.B $?
shell variable) to learn if any Attributes are out of bound, if the
S.M.A.R.T. status is failing, if there are errors recorded in the
self-test log, or if there are errors recorded in the disk error log.

.PP
.SH RETURN VALUES
The return values of smartctl are defined by a bitmask.  For the
moment this only works on ATA disks.  The different bits in the return
value are as follows:
.TP
.B Bit 0:
Command line did not parse.
.TP
.B Bit 1:
Device open failed, or device did not return an IDENTIFY DEVICE structure. 
.TP
.B Bit 2:
Some SMART command to the disk failed, or there was a checksum error
in a SMART data structure (see '\-b' option above).
.TP
.B Bit 3:
SMART status check returned "DISK FAILING".
.TP
.B Bit 4:
SMART status check returned "DISK OK" but we found prefail Attributes <= threshold.
.TP
.B Bit 5:
SMART status check returned "DISK OK" but we found that some (usage
or prefail) Attributes have been <= threshold at some time in the
past. 
.TP
.B Bit 6:
The device error log contains records of errors.
.TP
.B Bit 7:
The device self-test log contains records of errors.

To test within the shell for whether or not the different bits are
turned on or off, you can use the following type of construction (this
is bash syntax):
.nf
.B smartstat=$(($? & 8))
.fi
This looks at only at bit 3 of the exit status
.B $?
(since 8=2^3).  The shell variable
$smartstat will be nonzero if SMART status check returned 'disk
failing' and zero otherwise.

it does, a good place to start is  Section 8.41 of the 'AT
Attachment with Packet Interface-5' (ATA/ATAPI-5) specification.  This
documents the S.M.A.R.T. functionality which the smartmontools
utilities provide access to.  You can find Revision 1 of this document

Future versions of the specifications (ATA/ATAPI-6 and ATA/ATAPI-7),
and later revisions (2, 3) of the ATA/ATAPI-5 specification are
