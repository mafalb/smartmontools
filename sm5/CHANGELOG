NOTES FOR NEXT RELEASE:

    Next release: handle extended error and self-test logs gracefully.
    Parse and print attribute flag meanings


smartmontools-5.0-11

    when starting self-tests in captive mode ioctl returns EIO because
    the drive has been busied out.  Detect this and don't return an eror
    in this case.  Check this this is correct (or how to fix it?)
 
    fixed possible error in how to determine ATA standard support
    for devices with no ATA minor revision number.

    device opened only in read-only not read-write mode.  Don't need R/W 
    access to get smart data. Check this with Andre.

    smartctl now handles all possible choices of "multiple options"
    gracefully.  It goes through the following phases of operation,
    in order: INFORMATION, ENABLE/DISABLE, DISPLAY DATA, RUN/ABORT TESTS.
    Documentation has bee updated to explain the different phases of
    operation.  Control flow through ataPrintMain()
    simplified.

    If reading device identity information fails, try seeing if the info
    can be accessed using a "DEVICE PACKET" command.  This way we can
    at least get device info.

    Modified Makefile to automatically tag CVS archive on issuance of
    a release

    Modified drive detection so minor device ID code showing ATA-3 rev
    0 (no SMART) is known to not be SMART capable.

    Now verify the checksum of the device ID data structure, and of the
    attributes threshold structure.  Before neither of these
    structures had their checksums verified.

    New behavior vis-a-vis checksums.  If they are wrong, we log
    warning messages to stdout, stderr, and syslog, but carry on
    anyway.  All functions now call a checksumwarning routine if the
    checksum doesn't vanish as it should.

    Changed Read Hard Disk Identity function to get fresh info from
    the disk on each call rather than to use the values that were read
    upon boot-up into the BIOS.  This is the biggest change in this
    release.  The ioctl(device, HDIO_GET_IDENTITY, buf ) call should
    be avoided in such code.  Note that if people get garbled strings
    for the model, serial no and firmware versions of their drives,
    then blame goes here (the BIOS does the byte swapping for you,
    apparently!)
    
    Function ataSmartSupport now looks at correct bits in drive
    identity structure to verify first that these bits are valid,
    before using them.
    
    Function ataIsSmartEnabled() written which uses the Drive ID state
    information to tell if SMART is enabled or not.  We'll carry this
    along for the moment without using it.

    Function ataDoesSmartWork() guaranteed to work if the device
    supports SMART.

    Replace some numbers by #define MACROS

    Wrote Function TestTime to return test time associated with each
    different type of test.

    Thinking of the future, have added a new function called
    ataSmartStatus2().  Eventually when I understand how to use the
    TASKFILE API and am sure that this works correctly, it will
    replace ataSmartStatus().  This queries the drive directly to
    see if the SMART status is OK, rather than comparing thresholds to
    attribute values ourselves. But I need to get some drives that fail
    their SMART status to check it.


smartmontools-5.0-10
    Removed extraneous space before printing in some error messages
    Fixed additional typos in documentation
    Fixed some character buffers that were too short for their contents.

smartmontools-5.0-9

    Put project home path into all source files near the top
    Corrected typos in the documentation
    Modified Makefile so that Mandrake Cooker won't increment version number
    (unless they happen to be working on my machine, which I doubt!)

smartmontools-5.0-8:

    For IBM disks whose raw temp data includes three temps. print all
    three

    print timestamps for error log to msec precision

    added -m option for Hitachi disks that store power on life in
    minutes

    added -L option for printing self-test error logs

    in -l option, now print power on lifetime, so that one can see
    when the error took place

    updated SMART structure definitions to ATA-5 spec

    added -p option

    added -f and -F options to enable/disable autosave threshold
    parameters

    changed argv parsing to use getops -- elminate buffer overflow
    vulnerability

    expanded and corrected documentation

    fixed problem with smartd.  It did not actually call
    ataSmartEnable()!  Since the argument was left out, the test
    always suceeded because it evaluated to a pointer to the function.

    smartd: closed open file descriptors if device does not support
    smart. Note: this still needs to be fixed for SCSI devices


smartmontools-5.0-0  STARTED with smartsuite-2.1-2
