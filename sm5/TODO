This code was originally developed as a Senior Thesis by Michael Cornwell
at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory (now part of the Storage Systems
Research Center), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of
California, Santa Cruz. http://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/.


Testing
-------
Test with SCSI, FireWire, USB, and SATA devices.  Doug Gilbert is now
doing some of this.

Extensions
----------
Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-6 (support for extended error logs)

Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-7


smartctl: 
---------

Handle extended error and self-test logs gracefully.  Can someone tell
me a disk that supports more than ATA log pages 1 and 6?  I need to
get a disk so I can test this functionality, when I add it.

Perhaps modify the -q option (quiet mode) so that it only warns of ATA
errors if they have (say) taken place in the last 168 hours (week).

Parse and print more attribute flag meanings (IBM ones, eg performance
etc).

smartd:
-------

Perhaps change <nomailer> special argument to -m to have also
<nomailer_fork> which would actually work with -M exec to run the
executable/script in the background rather than in the foreground.
But let's wait for someone to request this. At that point we should
probably use fork/exec rather than system().

Perhaps change smartd to look in /proc/ide and /proc/scsi to see what
exists? If something doesn't exit then don't try to open it?  This
should probably be the default option if there is no configuration
file.

Add ability to monitor "worst" value from attributes (sometimes it
gets larger!) and to monitor the threshold value (sometimes it
changes!).

General Fixes
-------------

Fix lots of syntax like if (a != 0).  This is now pretty much confined
to the SCSI-only parts of the code.
