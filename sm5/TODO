Testing
-------
Test with SCSI devices (I can't do it -- Bruce)

Extensions
----------
Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-6 (support for extended error logs)

Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-7

Modifications
-------------

Handle extended error and self-test logs gracefully.  Can someone tell
me a disk that supports more than log pages 1 and 6?  I need to get a
disk so I can test this functionality, when I add it.

Change smartd so that it also monitors usage as well as prefail
attributes for failure or changes.  Make this a command line option

Perhaps change smartd to look in /proc/ide and /proc/scsi to see what
exists? If something doesn't exit then don't try to open it?

Currently smartd looks at attribute values and thresholds, then prints
out if there is an error condition.  Make it also look at the smart
status, if that is enabled and working and do that test as well.
Perhaps also see if the number of device errors has changed.

Add optional flags to /etc/smartd.conf, so that certain attributes are
ignored, or so that all usage attributes are ignored.

Change smartd so that it monitors the ATA disk error log, and if the
number of errors changes, log an entry..

Perhaps modify the -q option (quiet mode) so that it only warns of ATA
errors if they have (say) taken place in the last 168 hours (week).

Change input command line from using current command line format
(getopt) to getopt_long() for long input options.  This will be
helpful in adding device specific options.

Parse and print more attribute flag meanings (IBM ones, eg performance
etc).

Fixes
-----

Fix lots of syntax like if (a != 0)

Pass pointer to big structures like "device" and smartval, not the
whole 2kB of data!
