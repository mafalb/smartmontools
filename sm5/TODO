Research Center), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of

Testing
-------
Test with SCSI devices (I can't do it -- Bruce)

Extensions
----------
Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-6 (support for extended error logs)

Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-7

Modifications
-------------

Change smartd so that it also monitors usage as well as prefail attributes for failure
or changes.  Make this a command line option

Change smartd so that it monitors the ATA disk error log, and if the number of errors changes,
log an entry.

Change input command line from using current command line format
(getopt) to getopt_long() for long input options.  This will be
helpful in adding device specific options.

Command line option to specify devices to look for in smartd startup

Print flags meanings in Vendor Attribute list -- not hex value --

Fixes
-----

Fix lots of syntax like if (a != 0)

Pass pointer to big structures like "device" and smartval, not the
whole 2kB of data!
