Testing
-------
Test with SCSI devices (I can't do it -- Bruce)

Extensions
----------
Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-6 (support for extended error logs)

Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-7

Modifications
-------------

Change smartd so that it also monitors usage as well as prefail attributes for failure
or changes.  Make this a command line option

Perhaps change smartd to look in /proc/ide and /proc/scsi to see what exists? If something
doesn't exit then don't try to open it?

Currently smartd looks at attribute values and thresholds, then prints out if there is an
error condition.  Make it also look at the smart status, if that is enabled and working and
do that test as well.  Perhaps also see if the number of device errors has changed.

Change smartd so that it monitors the ATA disk error log, and if the number of errors changes,
log an entry..

Perhaps modify the -q option (quiet mode) so that it only warns of ATA errors if they have (say)
taken place in the last 168 hours (week).

Change input command line from using current command line format
(getopt) to getopt_long() for long input options.  This will be
helpful in adding device specific options.

Command line option to specify devices to look for in smartd startup

Print flags meanings in Vendor Attribute list -- not hex value --

Fixes
-----

Fix lots of syntax like if (a != 0)

Pass pointer to big structures like "device" and smartval, not the
whole 2kB of data!
