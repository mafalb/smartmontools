at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory (now part of the Storage Systems
Research Center), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of
California, Santa Cruz. http://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/.


Testing
-------
Test with SCSI devices (I can't do it -- Bruce)

Extensions
----------
Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-6 (support for extended error logs)

Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-7

Modifications
-------------

Change input command line from using current command line format
(getopt) to getopt_long() for long input options.  This will be
helpful in adding device specific options.

Command line option to specify devices to look for in smartd startup

Print flags meanings in Vendor Attribute list -- not hex value --

Fixes
-----
SCSI code in smartd leaves file descriptors open if SMART not supported..

Fix lots of syntax like if (a != 0)

Pass pointer to big structures like "device" and smartval, not the
whole 2kB of data!
