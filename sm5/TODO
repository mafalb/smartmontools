at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory (now part of the Storage Systems
Research Center), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of
California, Santa Cruz. http://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/.


Testing
-------
Test with SCSI devices (I can't do it -- Bruce)

Extensions
----------
Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-6 (support for extended error logs)

Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-7

Modifications
-------------

Add option to show if the WORST recorded value is ever <= threshold
and if this is true with for an non-prefailure or prefailure attribute.

Command line option to specify devices to look for in smartd startup

Print flags meanings in Vendor Attribute list -- not hex value --
especially for prefailure flag.

When actual attribute(s) less than threshold, print these clearly (highlighted)

Also, have test to see if vendor attributes are under threshold even if
prefailure bit NOT set (old age, for example).

Fixes
-----
int ataSmartStatus (int device ) is broken -- see comments in code.

SCSI code in smartd leaves file descriptors open if SMART not supported..

Fix lots of syntax like if (a != 0)

Pass pointer to big structures like "device" and smartval, not the
whole 2kB of data!
