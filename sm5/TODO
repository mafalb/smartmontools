USB devices under Linux
-----------------------
Some USB devices can hang smartctl or smartd.  This is because these
devices fail to comply with SCSI specifications for their packet
command sets.  Work on improving the detection and bail-out procedures
for these flawed devices, so that the user sees an informative error
message and smartd/smartctl don't hang.

ATA-6/7
-------
Support extended self-test logs

smartctl/smartd
---------------
Add additional -v options (corresponding to comments in
atacmds.c:ataPrintSmartAttribName().

smartctl: 
---------
Parse and print additional Attribute flag meanings (IBM ones, eg
performance etc).  These are now documented in atacmds.h -- we just
need to modify the format of the Attribute table.

Modify the SMART self-test log table printing so that we ALSO print
the value of the self-test failure checkpoint byte, if it's one of the
recognized values.  See routine SelfTestFailureCodeName and
documentation in atacmds.h.

smartd:
-------
Perhaps change <nomailer> special argument to -m to have also
<nomailer_fork> which would actually work with -M exec to run the
executable/script in the background rather than in the foreground.
But let's wait for someone to request this. At that point we should
probably use fork/exec rather than system().

Add ability to monitor "worst" value from attributes (sometimes it
gets larger!) and to monitor the threshold value (sometimes it
changes!).

Add command line option that scans devices then WRITES
/etc/smartd.conf, perhaps as /etc/smartd.conf.output, just for devices
that can be monitored.

Packaging
---------
Under freebsd and solaris, the following are wrong:
smartd.conf: has linux device paths
smart*.in  : man pages have (mostly) linux device paths
