Date: 2003-10-28
Summary: smartmontools release 5.22
-----------------------------------
Replaces flawed 5.21 release: the -T verypermissive option had to be
entered as -T verpermissive. First experimental solaris support (SCSI
only).


Date: 2003-10-14
Summary: smartmontools release 5.21
-----------------------------------
Preliminary support for FreeBSD added to smartmontools.  For FreeBSD,
ATA support requires a 5.1-CURRENT kernel while SCSI support should
work across multiple versions (any that support CAM).


Date: 2003-10-04
Summary: smartmontools release 5.20
-----------------------------------
Replaces flawed 5.19 release (which had a zero-length man page
smartd.conf.5).


Date: 2003-10-03
Summary: smartmontools release 5.19
-----------------------------------
This is the first release of smartmontools based on autoconf/automake.
For this reason, it is a very experimental release.  Please let us
know in particular about documenation errors/omissions, missing or
unneccesary files, and similar oversights.  The major changes are:
 [1]  installation scripts based on autoconfig/automake
 [2] ./configure [options] lets you set arbitrary paths
 [3] supports FHS with ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
 [4] correct paths are inserted into all man pages, binaries, etc.
 [5] tarballs and RPMs are now GPG-signed

Summary: smartd SEGV
--------------------
Some versions of smartd, including smartmontools release 5.1-18, will
SEGV if the combination of Directives in /etc/smartd.conf contains
-l error
AND/OR
-l selftest
without any Attribute monitoring Directives.  This is fixed in 5.19
and above.

A good workaround is to add:
-o on
OR
-o off
to enable or disable automatic offline data collection.

Summary: testunitready bug in smartd
------------------------------------
A bug in smartd prevented functioning on scsi devices.
The bug in question only affects smartd users with scsi devices.
To see if your version of smartd has the testunitready() bug, do
smartd -V
If the version of the module smartd.c in a line like:
Module: smartd.c revision: 1.66 date: 2002/11/17
has a revision greater than or equal to 1.30, and less than or
equal to 1.64, then your version of the code has this problem.

This problem affected releases starting with RELEASE_5_0_16 up to and
including RELEASE_5_0_43.
