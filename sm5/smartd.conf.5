.TH SMARTD.CONF 5  "$Date: 2002/11/08 12:00:05 $" "smartmontools-5.0"
.SH NAME
/etc/smartd.conf \- S.M.A.R.T. Monitoring Daemon Configuration File

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the configuration file for the
.B smartd
daemon, which 
monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) system built into many ATA-3 and later ATA,
IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives.

Note that
.B smartd
only reads the configuration file at start-up: changes to the
configuration file take effect only after the
.B smartd
daemon is restarted.  If you send a HUP signal to
.B smartd
it will log a polite message saying that it ignores this signal and
that it has
.I not
re-read the configuration file.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE /etc/smartd.conf
In the absence of a configuration file,
.B smartd 
will try to open the 12 ATA devices 
.B /dev/hd[a-l] 
and the 26 SCSI
devices 
.B /dev/sd[a-z]. 
This can be annoying if you have an ATA or SCSI device that hangs or
misbehaves when receiving SMART commands.  Even if this causes no
problems, you may be annoyed by the string of error log messages about
block-major devices that can't be found, and SCSI devices that can't
be opened.

One can avoid this problem, and gain more control over the types of
events monitored by
.B smartd,
by using the configuration file
.B /etc/smartd.conf.
This file contains a list of devices to monitor, with one device per
line.  An example file is included with the
.B smartmontools
distribution, and is normally placed in 
.B /etc/smartd.conf.example.
If
.B smartmontools
was properly installed on your system, you will also find this sample
configuration file in
.B /usr/share/doc/smartmontools-5.0/.
For security, the configuration file should not be writable by anyone
but root. The syntax of the file is as follows:

There should be one device listed per line, although you may have
lines that are entirely comments or white space.

Any text following a hash sign (#) and up to the end of the line is
taken to be a comment, and ignored.

Lines may be continued by using a backslash (\(rs) as the last
non-whitespace or non-comment item on a line.

Here is an example configuration file.  It's for illustrative purposes
only; please don't copy it onto your system without reading to the end
of the
.B DIRECTIVES
Section below!

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE DIRECTIVES
.PP

If the first non-comment entry in the configuration file is the text
string
.B DEVICESCAN
in capital letters, then
.B smartd
will ignore the configuration file, and will scan for devices.
.sp 2
The following are the Directives that may appear following the device
name on any line of the
.B /etc/smartd.conf
configuration file. Note that
.B these are NOT command-line options for 
.B smartd.
The command-line options for
.B smartd
are listed above.  The Directives below may appear in any order,
following the device name.  For the moment, apart from the '\-S'
Directive, these Directives only apply to ATA disks. 
.B  For ATA disks, if
.B no Directives appear, the disk will not be monitored.
The '\-a' Directive will try to monitor everything possible.
.TP
.B \-A
ATA: The device is an ATA device.  Don't try issuing SCSI commands to it.
.TP
.B \-S
SCSI: The device is a SCSI device.  Don't try issuing IDE/ATA
commands to it.  

In the absence of either of these Directives,
.B smartd
will attempt to guess the device type by looking at whether the fifth
character in the device name is an 's' or an 'h'.  If it can't guess
from this fifth character, then it will simply try to access the
device using first ATA and then SCSI ioctl()s.
.TP
.B \-C <N>
This sets the time in between disk checks to be 
.B <N>
seconds apart, where N is a decimal integer.  Note that although you can give this Directive
multiple times on different lines of the configuration file, only the
final value that is given is used.  That final value applies to all the disks.
The default value of 
.B <N> 
is 1800 sec, and the minimum allowed value is
ten seconds.
.TP
.B \-c
Check: Will check the SMART status of the disk.  If any Prefailure
Attributes are less than or equal to their threshold values, then disk
failure is predicted in less than 24 hours, and a message at priority
.B 'CRITICAL'
will be logged to syslog. [Please see the
.B smartctl \-c
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-l
Log: Report if that the number of ATA errors reported in the ATA
Error Log has increased since the last check.
[Please see the
.B smartctl \-l
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-L
Log: Report if that the number of errors reported in the SMART
Self-Test Log has increased since the last check.  Note that such
errors will
.I only 
be logged if you run self-tests on the disk (and it fails the 
tests!). [Self-Tests can be run by using the 
.B '\-SXsx' 
options of
.B smartctl,
and the results of the testing can be observed using the 
.B smartctl \-L
command line option.]
.TP
.B \-f
Fail: Check for 'failure' of any Usage Attributes.  If these
Attributes are less than or equal to the threshold, it does NOT
indicate imminent disk failure.  It "indicates an advisory condition
where the usage or age of the device has exceeded its intended design
life period."
[Please see the
.B smartctl \-v
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-p
Prefail: Report anytime that a Prefail Attribute has changed
its value since the last check, 30 minutes ago. [Please see the
.B smartctl \-v
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-u
Usage: Report anytime that a Usage Attribute has changed its value
since the last check, N seconds ago. [Please see the
.B smartctl \-v
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-t
Track: Equivalent to turning on the two previous flags '\-t' and '\-u'.
Tracks changes in
.I all
device Attributes. [Please see the
.B smartctl \-v
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-i <ID>
Ignore: This Directive modifies the behavior of the '\-f' Directive
and has no effect without it.  
.I This Directive requires a decimal integer argument <ID> in the range from 1 to 255.
It means to ignore device Attribute number <ID>, when checking for
failure of Usage Attributes.  This is useful, for example, if you have
a very old disk and don't want to keep getting messages about the
hours-on-lifetime Attribute (usually Attribute 9) failing.  This
Directive may appear multiple times for a single device, if you want
to ignore multiple Attributes.
.TP
.B \-I <ID>
Ignore: This Directive modifies the
behavior of the '\-p', '\-u', and '\-t' Directives
and has no effect without one of them.  
.I This Directive requires a decimal integer argument <ID> in the range from 1 to 255.
It means to ignore device Attribute <ID>, when tracking changes in the
Attribute values.  This is useful, for example, if one of the device
Attributes is the disk temperature (usually Attribute 194 or
231). It's annoying to get reports each time the temperature changes.
This Directive may appear multiple times for a single device, if you
want to ignore multiple Attributes.
.TP
.B \-a
All: equivalent to turning on the following Directives: 
.B '\-c' 
to check the SMART status,
.B '\-f' 
to report failures of Usage (rather than Prefail) Attributes,
.B '\-t' 
to track changes in both Prefailure and Usage Attributes,
.B '\-L' 
to report increases in the number of Self-Test Log errors, and
.B '\-l' 
to report increases in the number of ATA errors.
.TP
.B #
Comment: ignore the remainder of the line.
.TP
.B \(rs
Continuation character: if this is the last non-white or non-comment
character on a line, then the following line is a continuation of the current
one.
.PP
If you are not sure which Directives to use, I suggest experimenting
for a few minutes with
.B smartctl
to see what SMART functionality your disk(s) support(s).  If you do
not like voluminous syslog messages, a good choice of
.B smartd
configuration file Directives might be 
.B \-c \-L \-l \-f.
If you want more frequent information, use 
.B -a.
