== CREDITS ==
This code was originally developed as a Senior Thesis by Michael Cornwell
at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory (now part of the Storage Systems
Research Center), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of
California, Santa Cruz. http://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/


== OVERVIEW ==
SMARTMONTOOLS contains utilities that control and monitor storage
devices using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology
(S.M.A.R.T.) system build into ATA and SCSI Hard Drives. This is used
to check the reliability of the hard drive and to predict drive
failures.  SMARTMONTOOLS Version 5.x is designed to comply to the
ATA/ATAPI-5 specification (Revision 1).  Future releases of
SMARTMONTOOLS (Versions 6.x and 7.x) will comply with the ATA/ATAPI-6
and ATA/ATAPI-7 specifications.

This package is meant to be an up-to-date replacement for the
ucsc-smartsuite and smartsuite packages, and is derived from that
code.


== CONTENTS ==
The suite contains two utilities:

smartctl is a command line utility designed to perform
         S.M.A.R.T. tasks.such as disk self-checks, and to
         report the S.M.A.R.T. status of the disk.

smartd   is a daemon that periodically monitors S.M.A.R.T. status and
         reports errors and changes in S.M.A.R.T. attributes to syslog.

If you have just downloaded smartmontools from the URL above, then
you can read about these commands using the man pages.  Within this
directory the commands:
  man ./smartctl.8
and
  man ./smartd.8

will display the manual pages for the two commands.  If you have
already installed the package on your system, then:
  man smartctl
and
  man smartd
will display the same information.


== INSTALLATION ==
To install, use the commands:
  make
  make install
The tools require Linux kernel 2.2.14 or greater in order to run. Any
recent Linux distribution should support this package.
