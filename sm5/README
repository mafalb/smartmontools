== OVERVIEW ==
SMARTMONTOOLS contains utilities that control and monitor storage
devices using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology
(S.M.A.R.T.) system build into ATA and SCSI Hard Drives. This is used
to check the reliability of the hard drive and to predict drive
failures.  SMARTMONTOOLS Version 5.x is designed to comply to the
ATA/ATAPI-5 specification (Revision 1).  Future releases of
SMARTMONTOOLS (Versions 6.x and 7.x) will comply with the ATA/ATAPI-6
and ATA/ATAPI-7 specifications.

This package is meant to be an up-to-date replacement for the
ucsc-smartsuite and smartsuite packages, and is derived from that
code.


== CONTENTS ==
The suite contains two utilities:

smartctl is a command line utility designed to perform
         S.M.A.R.T. tasks.such as disk self-checks, and to
         report the S.M.A.R.T. status of the disk.

smartd   is a daemon that periodically monitors S.M.A.R.T. status and
         reports errors and changes in S.M.A.R.T. attributes to syslog.

You can read about these commands using the man pages.  Within this
directory the commands:
  man ./smartctl.8
and
  man ./smartd.8
will display the manual pages for the two commands.  If you install the package on
your system, then
  man smartctl
and
  man smartd
will display the same information.


== INSTALLATION ==
To install, use the commands:
  make
  make install
The tools require Linux kernel 2.2.14 or greater in order to run. Any
recent Linux distribution should support this package.
 
The files installed are:
/usr/sbin/smartd                   [Executable daemon]
/usr/sbin/smartctl                 [Executable command-line utility]
/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd            [Init/Startup script for smartd]
/usr/share/man/man8/smartctl.8.gz  [Manual page]
/usr/share/man/man8/smartd.8.gz    [Manual page]

Source and binary RPM files are available at the website listed above.


== USAGE ==
SMARTMONTOOLS contents two utilities:

smartctl - A command line control utility 
smartd  -  A monitoring daemon

to run smartctl, use the syntax

./smartctl [options] [device]  

See the man page for full details.  A summary of the options is:

Read only:
p       Print License/Copyright information.
i       Checks if the device supports S.M.A.R.T, and prints drive model
        information.
c       Checks if device has any S.M.A.R.T. Warranty Failures.  This means
        that the device is predicting failure in the next 24 hours.
g	Prints only the generic S.M.A.R.T. attributes 
v	Prints only the vendor specific S.M.A.R.T. attributes & thresholds
l	Prints only the S.M.A.R.T. error log
L       Prints only the S.M.A.R.T. self-test log
a	Prints all parameters for i,c,g,v,t,l,L

Enable/Disable commands:
e	Enables S.M.A.R.T. on device
d	Disables S.M.A.R.T. on device
f       Enables S.M.A.R.T. attributes auto-save on device
F       Disables S.M.A.R.T. attributes auto-save on device
t       Enables S.M.A.R.T. automatic offline self test timer which scans the
        drive every four hours for disk defects.
T	Disables S.M.A.R.T. automatic offline self test timer 

Test Commands:
O	Runs S.M.A.R.T. Immediate offline Test
S	Runs S.M.A.R.T. Short Self Test (usually under ten minutes)
s       Runs S.M.A.R.T. Short Self Test in Captive Mode. (WARNING this test
        will busy out drive for length of test )
X	Runs S.M.A.R.T. Extended Self Test (tens of minutes)
x       Runs S.M.A.R.T. Extended Self Test in Captive Mode. (WARNING this
        test will busy out the drive for the length of the test)
A 	Aborts Non-Captive S.M.A.R.T. Tests.

devices are IDE devices which usually are:

/dev/hda 	Primary Master
/dev/hdb	Primary Slave
/dev/hdc 	Secondary Master
/dev/hdd 	Secondary Slave	

for SCSI the devices are usually

/dev/sda	First SCSI Disk 
/dev/sdb	second SCSI disl

Examples:
  smartctl -e /dev/hda     - enables SMART on hard drive
  smartctl -c /dev/sda     - checks status of hard drive.
  smartd                   - starts background daemon to
                             monitor hard drive status

smartd will scan for all devices that support SMART and poll them very
thirty minutes for errors or for changes in attribute values. When an
error or attribute value change occurs, it sends log information to
the SYSLOG facility.  Typically these messages and warnings appear in
/var/log/messages.


== REFERENCES ==
If you need help in understanding the output of smartctl, a good place
to start is to read Section 8.41 of the AT Attachment with Packet
Interface-5 (ATA/ATAPI-5) specification.  This documents the
S.M.A.R.T. functionality which the smartmontools utilities provide
access to.  You can find Revision 1 of this document at:
http://www.t13.org/project/d1321r1c.pdf

Future versions of the specifications (ATA/ATAPI-6 and ATA/ATAPI-7)
can be obtained from:
http://www.t13.org/#FTP_site
Later revisions (2, 3) of the ATA/ATAPI-5 specification are also
available there.


The functioning of S.M.A.R.T. is also described by the SFF-8035i
revision 2 specification.  This is a publication of the Small Form
Factors Committee, and can be obtained from SFF Committee, 14426 Black
Walnut Ct., Saratoga, CA 95070, USA.
