.SH NAME
smartd \- S.M.A.R.T. Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smartd [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B smartd
is a daemon that monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) system built into many ATA-3 and later ATA,
IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives. The purpose of S.M.A.R.T. is to monitor
the reliability of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to
carry out different types of drive self-tests.  This version of
.B smartd
is compatible with ATA/ATAPI-5 and earlier standards (see 
.B REFERENCES
below)

.B smartd
will attempt to enable S.M.A.R.T. monitoring on ATA devices, and polls
these and SCSI devices every 30 minutes (configurable), logging
S.M.A.R.T. errors and changes of S.M.A.R.T. Attributes via the SYSLOG
interface.  These notifications and warnings normally appear in
.B /var/log/messages. 

.B smartd
can be configured at start-up using the file
.B /etc/smartd.conf.
Note that
.B smartd
only reads the configuration file at start-up: changes to the
configuration file take effect only after the
.B smartd
daemon is restarted.
If you send a 
.B HUP
signal to
.B smartd
it will log a polite message saying that it ignores this signal and
that it has
.I not
re-read the configuration file.

If you send a 
.B USR1 
signal to
.B smartd
it will immediately check the status of the disks, and then return to
polling the disks every 30 minutes. See the
.B '\-i'
option below for additional details.

On startup, in the absence of the configuration file
.B /etc/smartd.conf,
the 
.B smartd
daemon first scans for all devices that support S.M.A.R.T., using
.B "/dev/hd[a-l]"
for IDE/ATA devices, and 
.B "/dev/sd[a-z]"
for SCSI devices. It then monitors for
.I all 
possible S.M.A.R.T. errors (corresponding to the 
.B '\-a' 
Directive in the configuration file (see
.B CONFIGURATION FILE
below). Note that when there is no configuration file, and
.B smartd
scans for devices on startup,
.B warning messages may appear in /var/log/messages,
about missing block-major-xx devices.  These messages are usually
harmless. Alternatively, the configuration file can be used to exclude
non-existent devices by giving a list of devices to monitor at
start-up.

.SH 
OPTIONS
Long options are not supported on all systems.  Use
.B 'smartd \-h'
to see the available options.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Runs 
.B smartd 
in "debug" mode. In this mode, it does not 
.B fork
(2) and displays status information to STDOUT.  It also prints more
verbose information about what it is doing.
.TP
.B \-i N, \-\-interval=N
Sets the interval between disk checks to
.I N
seconds, where
.I N
is a decimal integer.  The minimum allowed value is ten and the maximum is the
largest positive integer that can be represented on your system (often 2^31-1).
The default is 1800 seconds.

Note that the superuser can make
.B smartd
check the status of the disks at any time by sending it the 
.B SIGUSR1
signal, for example with the command:
.nf
.B kill -SIGUSR1 <pid>
.fi
where 
.B <pid> 
is the process id number of
.B smartd.
One may also use:
.nf
.B killall -USR1 smartd
.fi
for the same purpose.

.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version, \-\-license, \-\-copyright
Prints license, copyright, and CVS version information onto
STDOUT and then exits. Please include this information if you are
reporting bugs, or have specific questions about the behavior of
.B smartd.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help, \-\-usage
Prints usage message to STDOUT and exits.
.TP
.B \-?
Same as
.B -h.

.SH EXAMPLES

.B
smartd
.fi
Runs the daemon in forked mode. This is the normal way to run
.B smartd.
Entries are logged to
.B /var/log/messages.

.fi
Note that 
.B smartmontools
provides a start-up script in
.B /etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd
which is responsible for starting and stopping the daemon via the
normal init interface. 
Using this script, you can start
.B smartd
by giving the command:
.nf
.B /etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd start
.fi
and stop it by using the command:
.nf
.B /etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd stop

.fi
If you want
.B smartd
to start running whenever your machine is booted, this can be enabled
by using the command:
.nf
.B /sbin/chkconfig --add smartd
.fi
and disabled using the command:
.nf
.B /sbin/chkconfig --del smartd

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE /etc/smartd.conf
In the absence of a configuration file,
.B smartd 
will try to open the 12 ATA devices 
.B /dev/hd[a-l] 
and the 26 SCSI devices
.B /dev/sd[a-z]. 
This can be annoying if you have an ATA or SCSI device that hangs or
misbehaves when receiving SMART commands.  Even if this causes no
problems, you may be annoyed by the string of error log messages about
block-major devices that can't be found, and SCSI devices that can't
be opened.

One can avoid this problem, and gain more control over the types of
events monitored by
.B smartd,
by using the configuration file
.B /etc/smartd.conf.
This file contains a list of devices to monitor, with one device per
line.  An example file is included with the
.B smartmontools
distribution, and is normally placed in 
.B /etc/smartd.conf.example.
If
.B smartmontools
was properly installed on your system, you will also find this sample
configuration file in
.B /usr/share/doc/smartmontools-5.1/.
For security, the configuration file should not be writable by anyone
but root. The syntax of the file is as follows:

.IP
There should be one device listed per line, although you may have
lines that are entirely comments or white space.

Any text following a hash sign (#) and up to the end of the line is
taken to be a comment, and ignored.

Lines may be continued by using a backslash (\(rs) as the last
non-whitespace or non-comment item on a line.

Here is an example configuration file.  It's for illustrative purposes
only; please don't copy it onto your system without reading to the end
of the

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE DIRECTIVES
.PP

If the first non-comment entry in the configuration file is the text
string
.B DEVICESCAN
in capital letters, then
.B smartd
will ignore the configuration file, and will scan for devices.
.sp 2
The following are the Directives that may appear following the device
name on any line of the
.B /etc/smartd.conf
configuration file. Note that
.B these are NOT command-line options for 
.B smartd.
The Directives below may appear in any order, following the device
name. 

.B  For ATA disks, if
.B no Directives appear, the disk will not be monitored.
Conversely, the '\-a' Directive will try to monitor everything
possible.

.B If a SCSI disk is listed,
it will be monitored at the only implemented level: roughly equivalent
to using the '\-H' option for an ATA disk.  So with the exception of '\-d', '\-m', and '\-M',
the Directives below are ignored for SCSI
disks.  For SCSI disks, the '\-m' Directive sends a warning email if
the SMART status indicates a disk failure or problem.

.TP
.B \-d TYPE
Specifies the type of the device.  This will prevent
.B smartd
from issuing SCSI commands to an ATA device and vice versa.  The valid
arguments to this Directive are \fIata\fP and \fIscsi\fP.

In the absence of this Directive,
.B smartd
will first attempt to guess the device type by looking at whether the sixth
character in the device name is an 's' or an 'h'.  This will work for
device names like /dev/hda or /dev/sdb.  If
.B smartd
can't guess from this sixth character, then it will simply try to
access the device using first ATA and then SCSI ioctl()s.
.TP
.B \-T TYPE
Specifies how tolerant
.B smartd
should be of SMART command failures.  The valid arguments to this
Directive are:

.I normal
\- do not try to monitor the disk if a mandatory SMART command fails, but
continue if an optional SMART command fails.  This is the default.

.I permissive
\- try to monitor the disk even if it appears to lack SMART capabilities.
This may be required for some old disks (prior to ATA-3 revision 4) that
implemented SMART before the SMART standards
were incorporated into the ATA/ATAPI Specifications.

[Please see the
.B smartctl \-T
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-o VALUE
Enables or disables SMART Automatic Offline Testing when
.B smartd
starts up and has no further effect.  The valid arguments to this
Directive are \fIon\fP and \fIoff\fP.

The delay between tests is vendor-specific, but is typically four hours.
[Please see the
.B smartctl \-o
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-S VALUE
Enables or disables Attribute Autosave when
.B smartd
starts up and has no further effect.  The valid arguments to this
Directive are \fIon\fP and \fIoff\fP.  [Please see the
.B smartctl \-S
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-H
Check the SMART health status of the disk.  If any Prefailure
Attributes are less than or equal to their threshold values, then disk
failure is predicted in less than 24 hours, and a message at priority
.B 'CRITICAL'
will be logged to syslog.  [Please see the
.B smartctl \-H
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-l TYPE
Reports increases in the number of errors in one of the two SMART logs.  The
valid arguments to this Directive are:

.I error
\- report if that the number of ATA errors reported in the ATA Error Log has
increased since the last check.

.I selftest
\- report if that the number of errors reported in the SMART Self-Test Log
has increased since the last check.  Note that such errors will
.I only
be logged if you run self-tests on the disk (and it fails the tests!).
[Self-Tests can be run by using the
.B '\-t\ short'
and
.B '\-t\ long'
options of
.B smartctl
and the results of the testing can be observed using the
.B smartctl '\-l\ selftest'
command-line option.]

[Please see the
.B smartctl \-l
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-f
Check for 'failure' of any Usage Attributes.  If these
Attributes are less than or equal to the threshold, it does NOT
indicate imminent disk failure.  It "indicates an advisory condition
where the usage or age of the device has exceeded its intended design
life period." [Please see the
.B smartctl \-A
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-m ADD
Send a warning email to the email address
.B ADD
if the '\-H', '\-l', or '\-f'
Directives detect a failure or a new error.
This Directive only works in conjunction with these other Directives
(or with the equivalent '\-a' Directive).  To prevent your email
in-box from getting filled up with warning messages, by default only a
single warning will be sent for each of the enabled test 
types, '\-H', '\-l', or '\-f', 
even if more than one failure or error is
detected or if the failure or error persists.  [This behavior can be
modified; see the '\-M' Directive below.]

The email is sent using the system 
.B mail
command.  In order that
.B smartd
find the mail command (normally /bin/mail) the
.B mail
command must be in the path of the
shell or environment from which
.B smartd
was started.  To test that the mail is being sent correctly, or to
alter the pattern of when mail is sent, see the `\-M' Directive below.

To send email to more than one user, please use the following form for the address:
.B  user1@add1,user2@add2,...,userN@addN
(with no spaces).
.TP
.B \-M TYPE
Modifies the behavior of the '\-m' email Directive above,
and has no effect without this other Directive.  This option controls
when, and how often, the '\-m' Directive sends email warning messages.
The valid arguments to this Directive are:

.I once
\- send only one warning email for each type of disk problem detected.  This
is the default.

.I daily
\- send additional warning reminder emails, once per day, for each type
of disk problem detected.

.I diminishing
\- send additional warning reminder emails, after a one-day interval,
then a two-day interval, then a four-day interval, and so on for each
type of disk problem detected. Each interval is twice as long as the
previous interval.

.I once,test daily,test diminishing,test
\- same as the respective arguments above, but also send a single test email
immediately upon
.B smartd
startup.  This allows one to verify that any email is correctly delivered.

.TP
.B \-p
Report anytime that a Prefail Attribute has changed
its value since the last check, 30 minutes ago. [Please see the
.B smartctl \-A
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-u
Report anytime that a Usage Attribute has changed its value
since the last check, N seconds ago. [Please see the
.B smartctl \-A
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-t
Equivalent to turning on the two previous flags '\-p' and '\-u'.
Tracks changes in
.I all
device Attributes. [Please see the
.B smartctl \-A
command-line option.]
.TP
.B \-i ID
Ignore device Attribute number
.B ID
when checking for failure of Usage Attributes.
.B ID
must be a decimal integer in the range from 1 to 255.  This Directive modifies
the behavior of the '\-f' Directive and has no effect without it.  

This is useful, for example, if you have a very old disk and don't want to keep
getting messages about the hours-on-lifetime Attribute (usually Attribute 9)
failing.  This Directive may appear multiple times for a single device, if you
want to ignore multiple Attributes.
.TP
.B \-I ID
Ignore device Attribute
.B ID
when tracking changes in the Attribute values.
.B ID
must be a decimal integer in the range from 1 to 255.  This Directive modifies
the behavior of the '\-p', '\-u', and '\-t' Directives and has no effect
without one of them.  

This is useful, for example, if one of the device Attributes is the disk
temperature (usually Attribute 194 or 231). It's annoying to get reports
each time the temperature changes.  This Directive may appear multiple
times for a single device, if you want to ignore multiple Attributes.
.TP
.B \-v N,OPTION
Modifies the labeling for Attribute N, for disks which use
non-standard Attribute definitions.  Valid arguments to this Directive
are:

.I 9,minutes
\- Raw Attribute number 9 is power-on time in minutes (not hours).

.I 9,temp
\- Raw Attribute number 9 is the disk temperature in Celsius.

.I 220,temp
\- Raw attribute number 220 is the disk temperature in Celsius.
.TP
.B \-a
Equivalent to turning on all of the following Directives: 
.B '\-H' 
to check the SMART health status,
.B '\-f' 
to report failures of Usage (rather than Prefail) Attributes,
.B '\-t' 
to track changes in both Prefailure and Usage Attributes,
.B '\-l\ selftest' 
to report increases in the number of Self-Test Log errors, and
.B '\-l\ error' 
to report increases in the number of ATA errors.
.TP
.B #
Comment: ignore the remainder of the line.
.TP
.B \(rs
Continuation character: if this is the last non-white or non-comment
character on a line, then the following line is a continuation of the current
one.
.PP
If you are not sure which Directives to use, I suggest experimenting
for a few minutes with
.B smartctl
to see what SMART functionality your disk(s) support(s).  If you do
not like voluminous syslog messages, a good choice of
.B smartd
configuration file Directives might be:
.nf
.B \-H \-l\ selftest \-l\ error \-f.
.fi
If you want more frequent information, use:
.B -a.

\# ENDINCLUDE
\# DO NOT MODIFY THIS OR PREVIOUS/NEXT LINES. THIS DEFINES THE 
\# END OF THE INCLUDE SECTION FOR smartd.conf.5

.SH NOTES
.B smartd
will make log entries at loglevel 
.B LOG_INFO
if SMART Attribute values have changed, as reported using the
.B '\-t', '\-p',
or
.B '\-u'
Directives. For example:
.nf
.B 'Device: /dev/hda, SMART Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 to 93'
.fi
Note that in this message, the value given is the 'Normalized' not
the 'Raw' Attribute value (the disk temperature in this case is about 22 
Celsius).  See the 
.B smartctl
manual page for further explanation.

.B smartd
will make log entries at loglevel
.B LOG_CRIT
if a SMART Attribute has failed, for example:
.nf
.B 'Device: /dev/hdc, Failed SMART Attribute: 5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct'
.fi
 This loglevel is used for reporting enabled by the
.B '\-H', \-f', '\-l\ selftest',
and
.B '\-l\ error'
Directives. Entries reporting failure of SMART Prefailure Attributes
should not be ignored: they mean that the disk is failing.  Use the
.B smartctl
utility to investigate.
