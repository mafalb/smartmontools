The following are reports of serious problems (eg system lockup) which
were due to smartmontools.  There is a "LINUX" and a "FREEBSD" section
below.

LINUX

You may also wish to search the linux.kernel mailing list for problem
reports concerning smartmontools.  Here is the URL:

SYSTEM:   Intel 875WP1-E motherboard with SATA drives on motherboard's SATA ports
PROBLEM:  smartd makes NTP time drift
REPORTER: nohez@cmie.com
LINK:     http://groups.google.de/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&selm=Pine.LNX.4.33.0310111545530.1047-100000%40venus.cmie.ernet.in.lucky.linux.kernel
NOTE:     When using SATA disks, linux kernel k_smp-2.4.21-108 (SMP because
          of hyper-threading) and xntp-4.1.1-177, the server time went
          out of sync with system time.  Problem goes away when SATA
          disks removed.


SYSTEM:   Dell servers using AACRAID (SCSI)
PROBLEM:  Locked up, needed to be rebooted
REPORTER: drew@eastvan.bc.ca

SYSTEM:   Box with Promise 20265 IDE-controller (pdc202xx-driver) and > 2.4.18 kernel with ide-taskfile support
PROBLEM:  Smartctl locks system solid when used on /dev/hd[ef].
REPORTER: Georg Acher <acher@in.tum.de>
LINK:     http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1457979&forum_id=12495
NOTE:     Lockup doesn't happen with 2.4.18 kernel, and doesn't affect /dev/hd[a-d]
          This appears to be a problem with the pdc202xx-driver and has been reported
          to the pcdx maintainers.  If you enable the the Promise-BIOS (ATA100-BIOS) then
          everything will work fine.  But if you disable it, then the machine will hang.


SYSTEM:   Box with Promise 20262 IDE-controller
PROBLEM:  Smartctl locks system solid
REPORTER: Ben Low <ben@bdlow.net>
LINK:     http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=5074201
NOTE:     Similar to previous report: Promise Ultra66 2-port card (20262) which, with
          linux 2.4.20, suffers from the lockups reported above.  But it was
          impossible to enable the Promiste BIOS.  A kernel patch is referenced
          to fix the problem.

SYSTEM:   Promise 20265
PROBLEM:  Smartctl locks system solid when used on CDROM/DVD device
LINK:     http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=208964
REPORTER: see above link
NOTE:     Problem seems to affect kernel 2.4.21 only.
