The following are controllers/drives where there have been reports of
serious problems (eg system lockup):

SYSTEM:   Dell servers using AACRAID (SCSI)
PROBLEM:  Locked up, needed to be rebooted
REPORTER: drew@eastvan.bc.ca
LINK:     http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1311313&forum_id=12495

SYSTEM:   Box with Promise 20265 IDE-controller (pdc202xx-driver) and > 2.4.18 kernel with ide-taskfile support
PROBLEM:  Smartctl locks system solid when used on /dev/hd[ef].
REPORTER: Georg Acher <acher@in.tum.de>
LINK:     http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1457979&forum_id=12495
NOTE:     Lockup doesn't happen with 2.4.18 kernel, and doesn't affect /dev/hd[a-d]
          This appears to be a problem with the pdc202xx-driver and has been reported
          to the pcdx maintainers.  If you enable the the Promise-BIOS (ATA100-BIOS) then
          everything will work fine.  But if you disable it, then the machine will hang.


SYSTEM:   Box with Promise 20262 IDE-controller
PROBLEM:  Smartctl locks system solid
REPORTER: Ben Low <ben@bdlow.net>
LINK:     http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=5074201
NOTE:     Similar to previous report: Promise Ultra66 2-port card (20262) which, with
          linux 2.4.20, suffers from the lockups reported above.  But it was
          impossible to enable the Promiste BIOS.  A kernel patch is referenced
          to fix the problem.
