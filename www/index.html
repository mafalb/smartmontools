<p>The smartmontools package contains two utility programs
(<font color="#3333ff"><b>smartctl</b></font> and
<font color="#3333ff"><b>smartd</b></font>) to control and monitor storage
systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology
System (SMART) built into most modern ATA and SCSI hard
disks.&#160; In many cases, these utilities will provide advanced warning
of disk degradation and failure.</p> 

<p>Smartmontools is originally derived from the Linux <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartsuite/">smartsuite
package</a>, and includes support for ATA/ATAPI-3 to -7 disks and SCSI
disk and tape devices.  It should run on any modern Darwin (Mac OSX),
Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, or <a

<b><a name="howtodownload"></a>How to download and install
smartmontools</b>

<p>There are different ways to get and install
smartmontools.&#160; You can use any of the procedures below
(the fourth is for Debian Linux only).&#160; Just after "Method 6" below are
some instructions for trying out smartmontools once you have completed
the installation. The 
<b><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/smartmontools/sm5/INSTALL?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">INSTALL</a></b> file contains additional information.
</p>
<b>First Method (Redhat/Fedora Linux) - Install from the RPM file</b>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest binary RPM file (<tt>*.rpm</tt>) from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64297">here</a>.&#160;
Don't get the SRPM file (<tt>*.src.rpm</tt>).<br/> SuSE users: use one of the SuSE-specific RPM files.</li>
<li>Install it using RPM.&#160; <i>You must be root to do this</i>:
<pre>su root (enter root password)
rpm -ivh smartmontools-5.32.i386.rpm</pre>
For most users, this is all that is needed.</li>
<li>If you receive an error message, you have probably previously
installed the <tt>smartsuite</tt> package, or RedHat's
<tt>kernel-utils</tt> package, which provide older versions of the
<tt>smartd</tt> and <tt>smartctl</tt> utilities.&#160; In this case you
should use the <tt>--nodeps</tt> or <tt>--force</tt> arguments of rpm to
replace these two utilities:
<pre>rpm -ivh --nodeps --force smartmontools-5.32.i386.rpm</pre></li>
<li>If you want to remove the package (<tt>rpm -e smartmontools</tt>)
and your system does not have <tt>chkconfig</tt> installed, you may need
to use:
<pre>rpm -e --noscripts smartmontools</pre></li>
</ul>

<b>Second Method (Linux/Solaris/FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Cygwin) - Install from the source tarball</b>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest source tarball from <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64297">here</a>.
Note: you probably want the most recent stable release. Stable releases have
even-numbered extensions, and unstable experimental releases have
odd-numbered extensions.</li>
<li>Uncompress the tarball:
<pre>tar zxvf smartmontools-5.32.tar.gz</pre></li>
<li>The previous step created a directory called <tt>smartmontools-5.32</tt>
containing the code.&#160; Go to that directory, build, and install:
<pre>cd smartmontools-5.32
./configure
make
make install
</pre></li>
<li> Note that the <tt>./configure</tt> step above is not possible for releases &lt;=5.1-18, you 
have to edit the Makefile by hand to change installation paths. For releases &gt;=5.19, <tt>./configure</tt>
can take optional arguments. These optional arguments are fully explained in the
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/smartmontools/sm5/INSTALL?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">INSTALL</a>
file. The most important one is <tt>--prefix</tt> to change the default installation directories.<p>
<i>Please note that the default installation location changed in versions &gt;=5.31.</i>
If you don't pass any arguments to <tt>./configure</tt> all files will reside under
<b>/usr/local</b> to not interfere with files from your distribution. For more detailed
information please also refer to the 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/smartmontools/sm5/INSTALL?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">INSTALL</a>
document.
</p>
</li>
<li>To compile from another directory (avoids overwriting virgin files from the smartmontools package)
replace <tt>./configure [options]</tt> by:
<pre>
mkdir objdir
cd objdir
../configure [options]
</pre></li>
<li>To install to another destination (useful for testing and to avoid overwriting an existing smartmontools installation)
replace <tt>make install</tt> by:
<pre>
make DESTDIR=/home/myself/smartmontools-test install
</pre>
Use a full path: <tt>~/smartmontools-test</tt> won't work.
</li>
<li>Unless the destination directory is your home directory (or a location that you have write permission)
only root can do <tt>make install</tt></li>
</ul>

<b>Third Method (Darwin/FreeBSD/Linux/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Solaris/Cygwin) - Install from the CVS repository</b>
<ul>
<li><p>One of the really cool things about CVS is that you can get
<i>any</i> version of the code you want, from the first release up the
the most current development version.&#160; And it's trivial, because
each release is <u>tagged</u> with a name like
<tt>RELEASE_5_1_18</tt>.&#160; You can see what the different names are
by looking at the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/smartmontools/sm5/">
CVS repository</a>.&#160; You'll see the tag names in the little scroll
window where it says "Show only files with tag".&#160; All you need to
do to get the latest development code is
(but note that the development code may be unstable, and that the
documentation and code may be inconsistent):</p>

<pre>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/smartmontools login (when prompted for a password, just press Enter)
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/smartmontools co sm5</pre></li>

<li>To instead get the 5.1-16 release:

<pre>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/smartmontools co -r RELEASE_5_1_16 sm5</pre></li>

<li><p>This will create a subdirectory called <tt>sm5/</tt> containing the
code.&#160; Go to that directory, build, and install:</p>
<pre>cd sm5
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
</pre>

<ul>
<li>See notes under <b>Second method - install from source tarball</b> for different options to <tt>./configure</tt>
and other useful remarks.</li>
<li>Skip <tt>./autogen.sh</tt> and <tt>./configure</tt> for tagged releases
&lt;= 5.1-18 (RELEASE_5_X_Y, where X = 0 or 1 and Y = 0 to 18).</li>
<li>If you get the current sources (<tt>cvs co</tt> with no arguments or do <tt>cvs up
-A</tt>) then you <i>will</i>  need those two additional steps.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>To update your sources to the 5.1-18 release:
<pre>cd sm5
cvs up -r RELEASE_5_1_18</pre></li>

<li>To update any tagged release to the latest development code:

<pre>cd sm5
cvs up -A</pre></li>
</ul>

<b>Fourth Method (Debian Linux) - Install the Debian package</b>
<ul>
<li>
The latest version of the smartmontools package in <i>.deb</i> format is
available at the  <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/smartmontools.html">Debian smartmontools
package page</a>.
This package is for the (unreleased) <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/">unstable</a>
distribution.</li>
<li>If you're running Debian <a
href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/">stable</a> please download the
package from <a
href="http://honk.physik.uni-konstanz.de/~agx/linux-i386/debian/smartmontools/">here</a>.</li>
<li>
You can then install the package using:
<pre>
dpkg -i smartmontools_5.1.18-1.agx0_i386.deb
</pre>
But the preferred method is to add the following line to your
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:
<pre>deb http://honk.physik.uni-konstanz.de/~agx/linux-i386/debian smartmontools/
</pre>
and type <pre>
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install smartmontools
</pre> this will automatically download and install the package.
</li>
</ul>


<b><a name="CygwinInstall"></a>
Fifth Method (Windows with <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>
installed) - Install the Cygwin package
</b>
<ul>
<li>To install it, use Cygwin's
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe">setup.exe</a>.
Add smartmontools download directory from any sourceforge mirror
(<b>http://<i>{belnet,easynews,heanet,switch,...}</i>.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/smartmontools/</b>)
in <i>Choose Download Site(s)</i>
and follow as usual (requires Cygwin <b>1.5.7 or greater</b>).
</li>
<li><p>If you want to manually install it (not recommended
because, among others, you lose the ability to update and uninstall it),
download the latest Cygwin package (<tt>*.cygwin.tar.bz2</tt>) from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64297">here</a>,
and type:</p>
<pre>
tar jxf smartmontools-5.32-1.cygwin.tar.bz2 -C /
</pre>
from a Cygwin shell.
</li>
</ul>

<b><a name="WindowsInstall"></a>
Sixth Method (Windows) - Install the Windows package
</b>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest Windows package (<tt>*.win32.zip</tt>) from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64297">here</a>.
</li>
<li><p>Unzip the files into a directory of your choice.
A directory in the PATH is recommended for the <tt>*.exe</tt> files.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<b>After installing it using Method 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 above, you can read the
man pages, and try out the commands:</b>

<pre>
man smartd.conf
man smartctl
man smartd
/usr/sbin/smartctl -s on -o on -S on /dev/hda (only root can do this)
/usr/sbin/smartctl -a /dev/hda (only root can do this)</pre>

<p>Note that the default location for the manual pages are
<tt>/usr/share/man/man5</tt> and <tt>/usr/share/man/man8</tt>.&#160; If
"<tt>man</tt>" doesn't find them, then you may need to add
<tt>/usr/share/man</tt> to your <tt>MANPATH</tt> environment
variable.</p>

<p>The Windows package (see Method 6 above) provides preformatted man pages
in <tt>*.html</tt> and <tt>*.txt</tt> format.</p>

</li>

<li><b>What are the future plans for smartmontools?</b>

<p>My plan is that smartmontools-5.x will support ATA/ATAPI-5
disks.&#160; Eventually, we'll do smartmontools-6.x to support
ATA/ATAPI-6 disks, smartmontools-7.x for the ATA/ATAPI-7 standard, and
so on.&#160; The "x" will denote revision level, as bugs get found and
fixed, and as enhancements get added.&#160; If it's possible to maintain
backwards compatibility, that would be nice, but I don't know if it will
be possible or practical.</p></li>

<li><b>Why are you doing this?</b>

<p>My research group at U. Wisconsin - Milwaukee runs a <a
href="http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/beowulf/medusa/">beowulf
cluster</a> with 600 ATA-5 and -6 disks (300 IBM and 300
Maxtor).&#160; We have more than 50 TB of data stored on the
system.&#160; I also help out with a <a
href="http://pandora.aei.mpg.de/merlin/"> cluster</a> at the Albert
Einstein Institute that has 540 IBM ATA-6 disks (65 TB
total). It's nice to have advanced warning when a disk is going to
fail.</p></li>

<li><b>Where can I find distribution-specific bug reports?</b>
<p>
The smartmontools package supports a number of different operating
systems. Some of those operating systems are also distributed by
multiple sources, and some of these maintain a database of bug
reports.  Here are links:

<li><b>I see some strange output from smartctl.  What does it mean?</b>

<p>The raw SMART attributes (temperature, power-on lifetime, and so
on) are stored in vendor-specific structures.&#160; Sometime these are
strange.&#160; Hitachi disks (at least some of them) store power-on
lifetime in minutes, rather than hours (see next question below).&#160; IBM disks (at least some
of them) have three temperatures stored in the raw structure, not just
one.&#160; And so on.&#160; If you find strange output, or unknown
attributes, please send an email to <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/smartmontools-support"> 
smartmontools-support</a> and we'll help you try and figure it
out.</p></li>

<li><b>What are the operating system requirements?</b>
<p>
Please see the first section of the <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/smartmontools/sm5/INSTALL?view=markup">INSTALL</a>
file.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>What Attributes does smartmontools not yet recognize?</b>

<p>From Maxtor disks (99), (100), and (101).  These are not used by
Maxtor in SMART revision 5.  They will be used in SMART revision 6,
but the engineering group has not yet decided what to monitor with
these Attributes.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>My Maxtor/Hitachi/Fujitsu disk is only a few days old, yet smartctl reports its age (Attribute 9) as thousands of hours!</b>

<p>On recent disks, Maxtor has started to use Attribute 9 to
store the power-on disk lifetime in minutes rather than hours.  In this case, use
the:<br/>
<tt>-v 9,minutes</tt><br/>
option to correctly display hours and minutes.
</p>
<p>Some models of Fujitsu disks use Attribute 9 to store
the power-on disk lifetime in seconds. In that case, use the:<br/>
<tt>-v 9,seconds</tt><br/>
option to correctly display hours, minutes and seconds.</p>
</li>

<li><b>The power-on timer (Attribute 9 raw value) on my Maxtor disk acts strange.</b>

<p>There are three related problems with Maxtor's SMART firmware:
</p>

<p>
<b>1 - </b> On some Maxtor disks, the raw value of Attribute 9 (Power
On Time) is <i>supposed</i> to be minutes. But it advances at an
unpredictable rate, always more slowly than one count per minute.
This is because when the disk is in idle mode, the counter stops
advancing.  This is only supposed to happen in standby mode.  This
will be corrected in Maxtor product lines released after October 2004.
</p>

<p>
<b>2 - </b> In Maxtor disks that use the raw value of Attribute 9 as a
minutes counter, only two bytes (of the six available) are used to
store the raw value.  So it resets to zero once every 65536=2^16
minutes, or about once every 1092 hours. This is fixed in all Maxtor
disks manufactured after July 2003, where the raw value was extended
to four bytes.
</p>

<p>
<b>3 - </b> In Maxtor disks that use the raw value of Attribute 9 as a
minutes counter, the hour time-stamps in the self-test and ATA error
logs are calculated by right shifting 6 bits.  This is equivalent to
dividing by 64 rather than by 60.  As a result, the hour time stamps
in these logs advance 7% more slowly than they should.  Thus, if you
do self-tests once per week at the same time, instead of the
time-stamps being 168 hours apart, they are 157 hours apart.  This is
also fixed in all Maxtor disks manufactured after July 2003.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>The time stamps in the self-test log of my Western Digital (WD) disk
don't correspond to the power-on time when the test was run</b>

<p>
The self-test log timestamps in many WD disks roll back to zero every
1092 hours (65536 minutes).  This problem is due to a WD firmware bug.
The power-on lifetime in hours is correctly stored in Attribute
9. However when the power-on lifetime is calculated for self-test log
entries, the lifetime in minutes is put into a 16-bit register then
divided by 60.  The 16-bit register overflows and wraps around every
1092 hours.
</p>

<p>For WD drives that exhibit this firmware bug, the relationship between
Attribute 9's raw value (H) and the time-stamps in the self-test log (h) are given by:<br/>
Let H = power on hours as shown by Attribute 9 (correct)<br/>
Let M = 60*H (power on minutes, correct)<br/>
Let m = M mod 65536 (incorrect value of power on minutes)<br/>
Let h = m/60 (incorrect value of power on hours, shown in self-test log)

<li><b>The (normalized) WORST Attribute values of my Western Digital
(WD) disk are <u>larger</u> than the (normalized) CURRENT Attribute
values</b>
<p>Western Digital firmware initializes SMART Attributes 10, 11, and
199 after either 120 spin-ups or 8 power-on hours.  Until that time,
they have the uninitialized value 253.

<li><b>Where can I find manufacturer-specific disk-testing
utilities?</b>

<p>A good listing of such utilities can be found <a
href="http://www.benchmarkhq.ru/english.html?/be_hdd2.html">here</a>.
Unfortunately most of these are for MS operating systems, but most can
be run from an MS-DOS boot disk. Note: if you do run one of these
utilities, and it identifies the meanings of any SMART Attributes that
are not known to smartmontools, please report them to the mailing list
above.</p>

<p>These utilities have an important role to fill.  If your disk has
bad sectors (for example, as revealed by running self-tests with
smartmontools) and the disk is not able to recover the data from those
sectors, then the disk will <i>not</i> automatically reallocate those
damaged sectors from its set of spare sectors, because
forcing the reallocation to take place may entail some loss of data.
Because the commands that force such reallocation are
<i>Vendor Specific</i>, most manufactuers provide a utility for this
purpose. It may cause data loss but can repair damaged sectors (at
least, until it runs out of replacement sectors).
</p>

<li><b>When I run <tt>smartd</tt>, the SYSLOG <tt>/var/log/messages</tt>

<pre>smartd: Reading Device /dev/sdv

<p>This is because when <tt>smartd</tt> starts, if there is no
configuration file, it looks for all ATA and SCSI devices to monitor
(matching the pattern <tt>/dev/hd[a-t]</tt> or
<tt>/dev/sd[a-z]</tt>).&#160; The log messages appear because your
system doesn't have most of these devices.</p>

<p>The solution is simple: use the <tt>smartd</tt> configuration file

<li><b>Can I monitor ATA disks behind SCSI RAID controllers?</b>

<p>
From release 5.1-18, smartmontools fully supports 3ware SCSI RAID
controllers that use ATA disks internally. To pass commands through
the 3ware controller, use the smartmontools <b>-d 3ware,N</b> option
or Directive.
</p>
<p>
3ware Linux device drivers (<tt>3w-xxxx</tt>) versions <b>1.02.00.036</b>
and earlier do not return the SMART HEALTH STATUS (smartmontools
<b>-H</b>) of the disks. In addition, the ENABLE AUTOMATIC OFFLINE and
ENABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE commands (smartmontools <b>-o on</b> and
<b>-S on</b>) can not be passed through the driver to the disks.
Later driver versions support <i>all</i> of these commands.  You may:
</p>
<ul>
<li>use version <b>1.02.00.037</b> or greater of the <tt>3w-xxxx</tt> driver, or</li>
<li><a href="3w-xxxx.txt">patch</a> earlier 3ware <tt>3w-xxxx</tt> drivers so that
these commands reach the disks, or</li>
<li> use an <b>unpatched</b> earlier <tt>3w-xxxx</tt> driver (which won't pass these
commands to the disks but will instead print
harmless warning messages to SYSLOG).</li>
</ul>
<p>
To see if your system's <tt>3w-xxxx</tt> driver has been patched, give the
command:<br/>
<tt>smartctl -H -S on -o on -d 3ware,? /dev/sd?</tt>
<br/>
If you
have an unpatched kernel, you'll see warning messages prompting you to
patch the kernel.</p>
<p>
The 3ware <tt>3w-xxxx</tt> version 1.02.00.037 driver first appeared
in kernel version 2.6.0-test5-bk11 on 24 September 2003 and in kernel
version 2.4.23-bk2 on 3 December 2003.  It was officially released on
the 3ware web site on December 19, 2003 as part of their
driver/firmware/utility package version 7.7.0.
</p>

<p>
Note (added 29 July 2004): starting with smartmontools (experimental)
release 5.33, one can also access SMART data from drives behind 3ware
controllers using the (character) devices /dev/twe0-15.  This should
work correctly even with older versions of the 3w-xxxx driver. One can
also access SMART data from drives behind 3ware 9000-series
controllers (3w-9xxx driver) using the (character) devices
/dev/twa0-15.
</p>

<li><a name="FAQ-database"></a><b>My ATA drive is not in the smartctl/smartd database.  Does this break anything? How do I get it added?</b>
<p>
 If your drive is not in the database, then the
 <i>names</i> of the Attributes (displayed in the <tt>ATTRIBUTE_NAME</tt> column of
 <tt>smartctl -A /dev/hd?</tt>) and the <i>format</i> of the the raw Attribute
 values shown in the <tt>RAW_VALUE</tt> column may be incorrect.  This
 is mostly cosmetic: the essential drive health monitoring/testing
 functionality of <b>smartmontools</b> does <i>not</i> depend upon the
 database.
</p>

<p>
<b>
 If your drive is not in the database, pleaes check <a

 new release has additional drives added to the database.  Please do
 not submit a new drive for the database without checking to see if it
 is already in the database of the current smartmontools release
 version.
</b>
</p>

<p>
<b> If your drive is not in the database of the current release,</b>
 to have it added to the database, first use the command:<br/>
 <tt>smartctl -t short /dev/hd?</tt><br/> to run a short self-test on
 the drive, and wait a few minutes for the test to complete.  Then
 email the entire output from:<br/> <tt>smartctl -a /dev/hd?</tt><br/>
 to <a
 href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/smartmontools-database">smartmontools-database</a>
 as a plain-text ASCII email attachment (file type: ".txt").  The timestamp
 in the self-test log will help us to determine whether Attribute 9 is
 being used to store the lifetime in hours, minutes, or seconds.
</p>
<p>
If you need to use any of the vendor-specific display options
 (<tt>-v</tt> options) with the drive, or if any of the Attributes are
 behaving strangely, please include that information as well.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>My ATA drive is failing its self-tests, but its SMART health status is 'PASS'. What's going on?</b>

<p>
If your ATA drive supports self-tests, you should run them on a
regular basis, for example one per week:
<br/><tt>smartctl -t long /dev/hd?</tt><br/>
After the test has completed, you should examine the results with:
<br/><tt>smartctl -l selftest /dev/hd?</tt><br/>
</p>

<p>
If the drive fails a self-test, but still has 'PASS' SMART health
status, this usually means that there is a corrupted sector on the
disk, which can not be read.  If the disk were able to read that
sector of data, even once, then the disk firmware would mark the
sector as 'bad' and then allocate a spare sectors to replace it.  But
if the disk can't read the sector even once, then it won't reallocate
the sector, in hopes of being able, at some time in the future, to
read the data from it.  See <a
href="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/BadBlockHowTo.txt">BadBlockHowTo</a>
for instructions about how to force this sector to reallocate (Linux
only).
</p>
<p>
The disk still has passing health status because the firmware has not
found other signs of trouble, such as a failing servo.
</p>
<p>
Such disks can often be repaired by using the disk manufaturer's 'disk
evaluation and repair' utility.  Beware: this may force reallocation
of the lost sector and thus corrupt or destroy any file system on the
disk. See <a
href="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/BadBlockHowTo.txt">BadBlockHowTo</a>
for generic Linux instructions.
</p>

</li>

<li><b>smartd is warning that my ATA disk has unreadable or uncorrectable or pending sectors. What's going on?</b>

<p>
Disk drives store data in blocks (sectors) of 512 bytes.  Each 512
bytes has additional bytes appended to it (usually 40 to 60) which are
used internally by the disk firmware for error checking/detection and
correction.  These are called ECC bytes.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the data in a sector gets corrupted.  This can happen
because a speck of dust scratched the disk, or because the disk was
powered down while writing data to that sector, or for other reasons.
Usually the ECC bytes can be used to correct the corrupted data.
However if the ECC bytes are inconsistent or can't be used to correct
the bad data, then the 512 bytes of data are lost.  Such a sector is
called unreadable or uncorrectable.
</p>
<p>
If your disk has an unreadable sector, this means that some of your
data can't be retrieved.  You can force the disk to replace the
unreadable sector with a spare good sector, but only at the price of
losing the 512 bytes of data forever.
</p>
<p>
Disks with uncorrectable sectors can often be repaired by using the
disk manufaturer's 'disk evaluation and repair' utility (see previous
FAQ entry).  Beware: this may force reallocation of the lost sector
and thus corrupt or destroy any file system on the disk. See <a
href="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/BadBlockHowTo.txt">BadBlockHowTo</a>
for generic Linux instructions.
</p>
<p>
Normally when an uncorrectable sector is found, the disk puts this
onto a 'pending sector list' to indicate that it should be replaced
with a spare good sector.  However this replacement won't take place
until either the disk can read the data on the bad sector, or is
commanded to write new data to that bad sector.
</p>

</li>


<li><b>My computer's BIOS has a SMART enable/disable setting.  What
does it do, and how should I set it?</b>
<p>
Some type of BIOS can check the SMART health status of a disk at
bootup: the equivalent of '<tt>smartctl -H /dev/hd?</tt>'.  This one-time check on
bootup is done if the BIOS SMART setting is set to 'ENABLE', and is
not done if the setting is set to 'DISABLE'.
</p>

<p>
If this one-time check is done, and the disk's health status is found
to be 'FAIL', then typically the BIOS will display an error message
and refuse to boot the machine.
</p>

<p>
For the proper functioning of smartmontools, either BIOS setting may
be used.

<li><b>My Fedora Core Linux system displays the startup message: smartd [FAILED]</b>
<p>
Fedora Core is distributed with a smartd configuration file
/etc/smartd.conf that monitors the first IDE disk /dev/hda.  If this
device does not exist (or lacks SMART capability) you will get the
error message above.  Look in SYSLOG (/var/log/messages) for
additional details about what is going wrong.
</p>
<p>
The solution: If your system has only SCSI disks, or has IDE disk(s)
on a non-primary controller, just edit /etc/smartd.conf to reflect the
correct location of the drive(s).  Please also read the 'smartd.conf'
man page for additional information.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Attribute 194 (Temperature Celsius) behaves strangely on my Seagate disk</b>
<p>
Some Seagate disks store the current temperature Celsius in both the
RAW and NORMALIZED Attribute 194 values, and the maximum lifetime
temperature in Celsius in the WORST value.  Since cooler is better,
this means that in this case, <i>lower</i> NORMALIZED Attribute values
are farther from failure, and that over time the WORST Attribute
values get <i>larger</i>, not <i>smaller</i> (as with other
Attributes).
</p>
</li>

<li><b>What's this smartctl message mean?: Warning: ATA error count 9 inconsistent with error log pointer 5</b>
<p>
The ATA error log is stored in a circular buffer, and the ATA
specifications are unambiguous about how the entries should be
ordered.  This warning message means that the disk's firmware does not
strictly obey the ATA specification regarding the ordering of the
error log entries in the circular buffer.  Smartmontools will correct
for this oversight, so this warning message can be safely ignored by
users.  (On the other hand, firmware engineers: please read the ATA
specs more closely then fix your code!).

</p>

<hr size="2" /><a name="testinghelp"></a><b>FireWire, USB, and SATA 
disks/systems</b>
<p>As for USB and FireWire (ieee1394) disks and tape drives, the news
is not good. They appear to Linux as SCSI devices but their
implementations do not usually support those SCSI commands needed by
smartmontools. The ieee1394 consortium recently certified the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">first</span> external enclosure (containing
a ATA disk and a protocol bridge) as being compliant to the relevant
standards. Such devices have already been on the market for about 3 
years and they tend to only support the bare minimum of commands
needed for device operation (i.e. SMART support is an unsupported
extra).<br />
</p>
<p>Smartmontools should work correctly with SATA drives under both
Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, <i>if</i> you use the standard IDE drivers
in <tt>drivers/ide</tt>. If you use the new <tt>libata</tt> drivers,
it won't work correctly because <tt>libata</tt> doesn't yet support
the needed ATA-passthrough ioctl() calls.  Jeff Garzik, the
<tt>libata</tt> developer, says that this support will be added to
libata in the future.  When this happens, we'll add support to
smartmontools for a new SATA/libata device type <tt>'-d sata'</tt>.
Typically, to force an SATA disk to run using the standard
(non-libata) drivers, you must use the BIOS to select "legacy mode"
for the controller.  If the IDE driver doesn't support your particular
SATA controller, or the controller doesn't have a legacy interface,
then only libata can be used.  Unless the hard disk controller on the
system motherboard is Intel, VIA or nVidia, standard IDE drivers may
not work
</p>

<hr size="2" /><a name="differfromsmartsuite"></a><b>How does
smartmontools differ from smartsuite?</b>

<p>The smartsuite code was originally developed as a Senior Thesis by
Michael Cornwell at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory (now part of the
<a href="http://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/">Storage Systems Research
Center</a>), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of
California, Santa Cruz.
You can find some information about the original smartsuite project here:
<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/archive/99-00/09-99/smart_software.htm">Press Release 1</a>, 
<a href="http://www.santa-cruz.com/archive/1999/September/22/local/stories/5local.htm">Press Release 2</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/99-00/09-27/smart.html">Press Release 3</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://csl.cse.ucsc.edu/smart.shtml">According to UCSC</a>
smartsuite is no longer maintained; the last release was in 2001.
</p>

<p>Smartmontools was derived directly from smartsuite.&#160; It differs
from smartsuite in that it supports the ATA/ATAPI-5 standard.&#160; So
for example <tt>smartctl</tt> from smartsuite has no facility for
printing the SMART self-test logs, and doesn't print timestamp
information in the most usable way.&#160; The <tt>smartctl</tt> utility
in smartmontools has added functionality for this (<tt>-q, -l selftest,-S,
-T, -v and -m</tt> options), updated documentation, and also fixes small
technical bugs in smartsuite. [One example: smartsuite does not actually use the
ATA SMART RETURN STATUS command to find out the health status of a disk.  It instead tries to infer this from the
SMART Attribute values.]&#160; See the 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/smartmontools/sm5/CHANGELOG?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/plain">CHANGELOG</a>
file in CVS for a summary of what's been done.&#160; The <tt>smartd</tt>
utility differs from the smartsuite <tt>smartd</tt> in major ways.&#160;
First, it prints somewhat more informative error messages to the syslog.
&#160; Second, on startup it looks for a configuration file
<tt>/etc/smartd.conf</tt>, and if <tt>smartd</tt> finds this file, it
monitors the list of devices therein, rather than querying all IDE and
SCSI devices on your system.&#160; (If the configuration file does not
exist, then it does query all IDE and SCSI devices.)&#160; Also, it's
a well-behaved daemon and doesn't leave open file descriptors and other
detrius behind.&#160; In addition, the <tt>smartmontools</tt> version of
<tt>smartd</tt> can be instructed (via Directives in the configuration
file) to monitor for changes in a number of different disk properties:
the SMART status, failure or prefailure attributes going below
threshold, new errors appearing in the ATA Error Log or the SMART
Self-Test Log, and so on. <tt>smartd</tt> can also send an email warning or run a
user-specified executable if it detects a problem with the disk.
</p>

<p>The other principle difference is that smartmontools is an
OpenSource development project, meaning that we keep the files in CVS,
and that other developers who wish to contribute can commit changes to
the archive. If you would like to contribute, please write to to <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/smartmontools-support">smartmontools-support</a>.</p>

<p>But the bottom line is that the code in smartmontools is derived
directly from smartsuite and is similar.&#160; The smartsuite package
can be found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartsuite/">here</a>.</p>
