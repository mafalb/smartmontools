<!-- Strange output -->
<h3><a name="strange-output"></a>I see some strange output from <tt>smartctl</tt>.  What does it mean?</h3>

<p>The raw SMART attributes (temperature, power-on lifetime, and so
on) are stored in vendor-specific structures. Sometime these are
strange. Hitachi disks (at least some of them) store power-on
lifetime in minutes, rather than hours (see next question below). IBM disks (at least some
of them) have three temperatures stored in the raw structure, not just
one. And so on. If you find strange output, or unknown
attributes, please send an email to <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/smartmontools-support"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />
smartmontools-support</a> and we'll help you try and figure it out.</p>
<hr />

<!-- Disk temperature -->
<h3><a name="disk-temperature"></a>Why is my disk temperature s reported by <tt>smartd</tt> as 150 Celsius?</h3>

<p>It's not.  Please read the end of the <tt>smartd</tt> man page (NOTES).
For example, in the message:
<br />'<span class="code">Device: /dev/hda, SMART Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 to 93</span>'<br />
the value given is the <em>Normalized</em> not the <em>Raw</em> Attribute value (the
disk temperature in this case is about 22 Celsius).  The
<span class="code">-R</span> and <span class="code">-r</span> Directives modify this behavior, so that
the information is printed with the <em>Raw</em> values as well, for example:
<br />'<span class="code">Device: /dev/hda, SMART Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 [Raw 22] to 93 [Raw 23]</span>'<br />
Here the Raw values are the actual disk temperatures in Celsius.  The
way in which the Raw values are printed, and the names under which the
Attributes are reported, is governed by the various
'<span class="code">-v Num,Description</span>' Directives described in the <tt>smartd</tt>
man page. Please see the <tt>smartctl</tt> manual page for further
explanation of the differences between <em>Normalized</em> and <em>Raw</em> Attribute values.</p>
<hr />

<!-- Special age attributes -->
<h3><a name="age-attribute"></a>My Maxtor/Hitachi/Fujitsu disk is only a few days old, yet <tt>smartctl</tt> reports its age (Attribute 9) as thousands of hours!</h3>

<p>On recent disks, Maxtor has started to use Attribute 9 to
store the power-on disk lifetime in minutes rather than hours.  In this case, use
the:
<br />'<span class="code">-v 9,minutes</span>'<br/>
option to correctly display hours and minutes.</p>

<p>Some models of Fujitsu disks use Attribute 9 to store
the power-on disk lifetime in seconds. In that case, use the:
<br />'<span class="code">-v 9,seconds</span>'<br/>
option to correctly display hours, minutes and seconds.</p>
<hr />

<!-- Special age attributes Maxtor -->
<h3><a name="age-attributes-maxtor"></a>The power-on timer (Attribute 9 raw value) on my Maxtor disk acts strange.</h3>

<p>There are three related problems with Maxtor's SMART firmware:</p>

<ol>
<li>On some Maxtor disks, the raw value of Attribute 9 (Power
On Time) is <em>supposed</em> to be minutes. But it advances at an
unpredictable rate, always more slowly than one count per minute.
This is because when the disk is in idle mode, the counter stops
advancing.  This is only supposed to happen in standby mode.  This
will be corrected in Maxtor product lines released after October 2004.<br /><br /></li>

<li>In Maxtor disks that use the raw value of Attribute 9 as a
minutes counter, only two bytes (of the six available) are used to
store the raw value.  So it resets to zero once every 65536=2^16
minutes, or about once every 1092 hours. This is fixed in all Maxtor
disks manufactured after July 2003, where the raw value was extended
to four bytes.<br /><br /></li>

<li>In Maxtor disks that use the raw value of Attribute 9 as a
minutes counter, the hour time-stamps in the self-test and ATA error
logs are calculated by right shifting 6 bits.  This is equivalent to
dividing by 64 rather than by 60.  As a result, the hour time stamps
in these logs advance 7% more slowly than they should.  Thus, if you
do self-tests once per week at the same time, instead of the
time-stamps being 168 hours apart, they are 157 hours apart.  This is
also fixed in all Maxtor disks manufactured after July 2003.<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<hr />

<!-- Selftests time stamp don't correspond to power-on time -->
<h3><a name="time-stamps-WD"></a>The time stamps in the self-test log of my Western Digital (WD) disk
don't correspond to the power-on time when the test was run.</h3>

<p>
The self-test log timestamps in many WD disks roll back to zero every
1092 hours (65536 minutes).  This problem is due to a WD firmware bug.
The power-on lifetime in hours is correctly stored in Attribute
9. However when the power-on lifetime is calculated for self-test log
entries, the lifetime in minutes is put into a 16-bit register then
divided by 60.  The 16-bit register overflows and wraps around every
1092 hours.</p>

<p>For WD drives that exhibit this firmware bug, the relationship between
Attribute 9's raw value (H) and the time-stamps in the self-test log (h) are given by:<br />
Let H = power on hours as shown by Attribute 9 (correct)<br />
Let M = 60*H (power on minutes, correct)<br />
Let m = M mod 65536 (incorrect value of power on minutes)<br />
Let h = m/60 (incorrect value of power on hours, shown in self-test log)</p>
<hr />

<!-- Normalized values larger than current values -->
<h3><a name="worst-larger-than-current"></a>The (normalized) WORST Attribute values of my Western Digital
(WD) disk are <strong>larger</strong> than the (normalized) CURRENT Attribute values</h3>
<p>Western Digital firmware initializes SMART Attributes 10, 11, and
199 after either 120 spin-ups or 8 power-on hours.  Until that time,
they have the uninitialized value 253.</p>
<hr />

<!-- Attributes not recognized -->
<h3><a name="attributes-not-recognized"></a>What Attributes does smartmontools not yet recognize?</h3>
<p>From Maxtor disks (99), (100), and (101).  These are not used by
Maxtor in SMART revision 5.  They will be used in SMART revision 6,
but the engineering group has not yet decided what to monitor with these Attributes.</p>
<hr />

<!-- Operating system requirements -->
<h3><a name="os-requirements">What are the operating system requirements?</a></h3>

<p>Please see the first section of the
<a href="http://smartmontools.cvs.sourceforge.net/smartmontools/sm5/INSTALL?view=markup">
INSTALL</a> file.</p>
<hr />

<!-- manufacturer-specific disk-testing utilities -->
<h3><a name="UBCD"></a><b>Where can I find manufacturer-specific
disk-testing utilities?</b></h3>

<p>A good listing of such utilities can be found <a
href="http://www.benchmarkhq.ru/english.html?/be_hdd2.html"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />here</a>.
Unfortunately most of these are for MS operating systems, but most can
be run from a MS-DOS boot disk.
The <a href="http://ubcd.sourceforge.net/"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />UBCD (Ultimate Boot CD)</a>
includes most of these disk-testing utilities and many other useful
diagnostic tools ready to boot from CD or USB memory stick.
The UBCD can be customized by adding other images, like one
<a href="faq.html#bootable">containing smartmontools</a>.
</p>

<p>Note: if you do run one of these utilities, and it identifies the
meanings of any SMART Attributes that are not known to smartmontools,
please report them to the
<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/smartmontools-support"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />smartmontools-support mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>These utilities have an important role to fill.  If your disk has
bad sectors (for example, as revealed by running self-tests with
smartmontools) and the disk is not able to recover the data from those
sectors, then the disk will <em>not</em> automatically reallocate those
damaged sectors from its set of spare sectors, because
forcing the reallocation to take place may entail some loss of data.
Because the commands that force such reallocation are
<em>Vendor Specific</em>, most manufactuers provide a utility for this
purpose. It may cause data loss but can repair damaged sectors (at
least, until it runs out of replacement sectors).</p>
<hr />

<!-- Can't locate module block-major-65 -->
<h3><a name="block-major-65"></a>I found in syslog: '<span class="code">Can't locate module block-major-65</span>'</h3>

<p>When I run <tt>smartd</tt>, the SYSLOG <span class="code">/var/log/messages</span>
contains messages like this:
<br />'<span class="code">smartd: Reading Device /dev/sdv
modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module block-major-65</span>'</p>

<p>This is because when <tt>smartd</tt> starts, if there is no
configuration file, it looks for all ATA and SCSI devices to monitor
(matching the pattern <tt>/dev/hd[a-t]</tt> or
<tt>/dev/sd[a-z]</tt>). The log messages appear because your
system doesn't have most of these devices.</p>

<p>The solution is simple: use the <tt>smartd</tt> configuration file
<tt>/etc/smartd.conf</tt> to specify which devices to monitor.</p>
<hr />

<!-- IBM-Firmware -->
<h3><a name="ibm-firmware"></a>What's the story on IBM SMART disks?</h3>

<p>Apparently some of the older SMART firmware on IBM disks can
interfere with the regular operation of the disk. If you have this
problem, here are some links to an IBM Firmware Upgrade that fixes the problem:</p>

</ul>
<hr />

<!-- Check Signature -->
<h3><a name="check-signature"></a>How can I check that the package hasn't been tampered with?</h3>

<p>Since the <tt>smartmontools</tt> utilities run as root, you might
be concerned about something harmful being embedded within
them. Starting with release 5.19 of <tt>smartmontools</tt>, the .rpm
files and tarball have been GPG signed. The tarball's fingerprint is
given in a file on the release page with a name like
<tt>smartmontools-5.32.tar.gz.asc</tt>. </p>

Please verify these using the
<ul>

<!-- Bootable CD -->
<h3><a name="bootable-cd"></a>Is there a bootable standalone CD or floppy that contains smartmontools?</h3>

<p>If you have a system that is showing signs of disk trouble (for
example, it's unbootable and the console is full of disk error
messages) it can be handy to have a version of smartmontools that can
be run off of a bootable CD or floppy to examine the disk's SMART data and run
self-tests.  This is also useful if you want to run Captive Self-Tests
(the <b><tt>-<font size="+2">C</font></tt></b> option of
<b><tt>smartctl</tt></b> ) on disks that can not easily be unmounted,
such as those hosting the Operating System files. Or you can use
this to run <tt>smartctl</tt> on computers that don't use Linux as the
day-to-day operating system.</p>

<!-- Disks behind RAID-Controllers -->
<h3><a name="FAQ-RAID"></a>Can I monitor disks behind RAID controllers?</h3>

<p>RAID controllers typically simulate a (logical) disk for each array of
(physical) disks to the OS.
Access to SMART functionality relies on ATA or SCSI pass through I/O controls
providing direct access to each physical disk.
But the standard I/O controls available are usually not designed to make this
distinction between logical and physical disks.
Therefore, smartmontools has to use vendor specific I/O controls.
Support for disks behind RAID controllers is highly dependent on both platform
and controller type.</p>
<ul>
<li>3ware RAID controllers are supported on Linux since smartmontools release 5.1-18.
Support for char devices /dev/tw* was added in release 5.33.</li>
<li>3ware support on FreeBSD is available since release 5.33, multiple controller and
char device support was added in release 5.36.</li>
<li><span class="marked">3ware 9000 support for Windows was added 2006-09-27, the corresponding 3ware

<!-- Change of version scheme -->
<h3><a name="version-scheme-change"></a>Why did the release version scheme change?</h3>

<p>It was non-standard.  So with the move to GNU Autoconf and GNU
Automake it changed from 5.X-Y (where X and Y are one or more digits)
to 5.Y. Starting with the first release, and moving forward in time, the releases are
numbered as follows:</p>
<pre>
5.0-1,
5.0-2,
...,
5.0-45,
5.1-1,
...,
5.1-18,
5.19,
5.20,
...

<!-- Add drive to database -->
<h3><a name="FAQ-database"></a>My ATA drive is not in the <tt>smartctl</tt>/<tt>smartd</tt> database.  Does this break anything? How do I get it added?</h3>
<p> If your drive is not in the database, then the
 <i>names</i> of the Attributes (displayed in the <tt>ATTRIBUTE_NAME</tt> column of
 <tt>smartctl -A /dev/hd?</tt>) and the <i>format</i> of the the raw Attribute
 values shown in the <tt>RAW_VALUE</tt> column may be incorrect.  This
 is mostly cosmetic: the essential drive health monitoring/testing
 functionality of <b>smartmontools</b> does <i>not</i> depend upon the
 database.
</p>

<p><b>If your drive is not in the database, pleaes check the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64297">sourceforge project page</a>
 to be sure that you are using the latest smartmontools release.  Each
 new release has additional drives added to the database.  Please do
 not submit a new drive for the database without checking to see if it
 is already in the database of the current smartmontools release
 version.</b></p>

<p><b> If your drive is not in the database of the current release,</b>
 to have it added to the database, first use the command:<br/>
 <span class="code">smartctl -t short /dev/hd?</span><br/> to run a short self-test on
 the drive, and wait a few minutes for the test to complete.  Then
 email the entire output from:<br/> <span class="code">smartctl -a /dev/hd?</span><br/>
 to <a
 href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/smartmontools-database">smartmontools-database</a>
 as a plain-text ASCII email attachment (file type: ".txt").  The timestamp
 in the self-test log will help us to determine whether Attribute 9 is
 being used to store the lifetime in hours, minutes, or seconds.</p>

<p>If you need to use any of the vendor-specific display options
 (<tt>-v</tt> options) with the drive, or if any of the Attributes are
 behaving strangely, please include that information as well.</p>
<hr />

<!-- Selftest failed but status is 'PASS' -->
<h3><a name="selftest-failed"></a>My ATA drive is failing its self-tests, but its SMART health status is 'PASS'. What's going on?</h3>

<p>If your ATA drive supports self-tests, you should run them on a
regular basis, for example one per week:
<br/><span class="code">smartctl -t long /dev/hd?</span><br/>
After the test has completed, you should examine the results with:
<br/><span class="code">smartctl -l selftest /dev/hd?</span></p>

<p>If the drive fails a self-test, but still has '<tt>PASS</tt>' SMART health
status, this usually means that there is a corrupted (uncorrectable=UNC) sector on the
disk. This means that the ECC data stored at that sector is not
consistent with the user data stored at that sector, and an attempt to read the sector fails with a UNC error.
This can be a one-time transient effect: a sudden power failure
while the disk was writing to the sector corrupted the
ECC code or data, but the sector <em>could</em> correctly store new data.
Or it can be a permanent effect: the magnetic media
has been damaged by a bit of dust, and the sector could <em>not</em> correctly store new data.</p>

<p>If the disk can read the
sector of data a single time, and the damage is permanent, not transient, then the disk firmware will mark the
sector as 'bad' and allocate a spare sector to replace it.  But
if the disk can't read the sector even once, then it won't reallocate
the sector, in hopes of being able, at some time in the future, to
read the data from it.  <b>A write to an unreadable (corrupted) sector will fix the problem.</b>
If the damage is transient, then new consistent data will be written to the sector.
If the damange is permanent, then the write will force sector reallocation.
Please see <a
href="badblockhowto.html" target="_blank">Bad block HOWTO</a>
for instructions about how to force this sector to reallocate (Linux only).</p>

<p>The disk still has passing health status because the firmware has not
found other signs of trouble, such as a failing servo.</p>

<p>Such disks can often be repaired by using the disk manufaturer's 'disk
evaluation and repair' utility.  Beware: this may force reallocation
of the lost sector and thus corrupt or destroy any file system on the
disk. See <a
href="badblockhowto.html" target="_blank">Bad block HOWTO</a>
for generic Linux instructions.</p>

<!-- corrupt sectors -->
<h3><a name="corrupt-sectors"></a><tt>smartd</tt> is warning that my ATA disk has unreadable or uncorrectable or pending sectors. What's going on?</h3>

<p>
Disk drives store data in blocks (sectors) of 512 bytes.  Each 512
bytes has additional bytes appended to it (usually 40 to 60) which are
used internally by the disk firmware for error checking/detection and
correction.  These are called ECC bytes.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the data in a sector gets corrupted.  This can happen
because a speck of dust scratched the disk, or because the disk was
powered down while writing data to that sector, or for other reasons.
Usually the ECC bytes can be used to correct the corrupted data.
However if the ECC bytes are inconsistent or can't be used to correct
the bad data, then the 512 bytes of data are lost.  Such a sector is
called unreadable or uncorrectable.
</p>
<p>
If your disk has an unreadable sector, this means that some of your
data can't be retrieved.  You can force the disk to replace the
unreadable sector with a spare good sector, but only at the price of
losing the 512 bytes of data forever.
</p>
<p>
Disks with uncorrectable sectors can often be repaired by using the
disk manufaturer's 'disk evaluation and repair' utility (see previous
FAQ entry).  Beware: this may force reallocation of the lost sector
and thus corrupt or destroy any file system on the disk. See <a
href="badblockhowto.html">Bad block HOWTO</a>
for generic Linux instructions.
</p>
<p>
Normally when an uncorrectable sector is found, the disk puts this
onto a 'pending sector list' to indicate that it should be replaced
with a spare good sector.  However this replacement won't take place
until either the disk can read the data on the bad sector, or is
commanded to write new data to that bad sector.
</p>

<h3><a name="bios-setting"></a>My computer's BIOS has a SMART enable/disable setting.  What
does it do, and how should I set it?</h3>

<p>Some type of BIOS can check the SMART health status of a disk at
bootup: the equivalent of '<span class="code">smartctl -H /dev/hd?</span>'.  This one-time check on
bootup is done if the BIOS SMART setting is set to '<tt>ENABLE</tt>', and is
not done if the setting is set to '<tt>DISABLE</tt>'.</p>

<p>If this one-time check is done, and the disk's health status is found
to be '<tt>FAIL</tt>', then typically the BIOS will display an error message
and refuse to boot the machine.</p>

<p>For the proper functioning of smartmontools, either BIOS setting may
be used.</p>
<hr />

<h3><a name="fedora-failed"></a>My Fedora Core Linux system displays the startup message: smartd [FAILED]</h3>

<p>Fedora Core is distributed with a <tt>smartd</tt> configuration file
<tt>/etc/smartd.conf</tt> that monitors the first IDE disk /dev/hda.  If this
device does not exist (or lacks SMART capability) you will get the
error message above.  Look in SYSLOG (/var/log/messages) for
additional details about what is going wrong.</p>

<p>The solution: If your system has only SCSI disks, or has IDE disk(s)
on a non-primary controller, just edit <tt>/etc/smartd.conf</tt> to reflect the
correct location of the drive(s).  Please also read the <tt>smartd.conf</tt>
man page for additional information.</p>
<hr />

<h3><a name="temp-seagate"></a>Attribute 194 (Temperature Celsius) behaves strangely on my Seagate disk</h3>

<p>Some Seagate disks store the current temperature Celsius in both the
RAW and NORMALIZED Attribute 194 values, and the maximum lifetime
temperature in Celsius in the WORST value.  Since cooler is better,
this means that in this case, <em>lower</em> NORMALIZED Attribute values
are farther from failure, and that over time the WORST Attribute
values get <em>larger</em>, not <em>smaller</em> (as with other
Attributes).</p>
<hr />

<h3><a name="ata-error-count"></a>What's this <tt>smartctl</tt> message mean?: Warning: ATA error count 9 inconsistent with error log pointer 5</h3>

<p>The ATA error log is stored in a circular buffer, and the ATA
specifications are unambiguous about how the entries should be
ordered.  This warning message means that the disk's firmware does not
strictly obey the ATA specification regarding the ordering of the
error log entries in the circular buffer.  Smartmontools will correct
for this oversight, so this warning message can be safely ignored by
users.  (On the other hand, firmware engineers: please read the ATA
specs more closely then fix your code!).</p>
<hr />

<h3><a name="FAQ-win-ata-as-scsi"></a>On Windows, <tt>smartctl</tt> aborts
with the message "...SMART_GET_VERSION failed". What is going wrong?</h3>

<p>A failing
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms803644.aspx"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />SMART_GET_VERSION</a>
call means that the device driver does not
implement the I/O controls (see <a href="faq.html#FAQ-win-ioctl">below</a>)
to access ATA SMART functionality.</p>

<p>Some Windows drivers for (S)ATA controllers are implemented as SCSI
class drivers. This is usually the case for drivers which support RAID.
Unfortunately, such drivers do not support the ATA specific SMART I/O
controls.</p>
<hr />

<h3><a name="FAQ-win-ioctl"></a>On Windows, <tt>smartctl</tt> prints the
message: "...Log Read failed: Function not implemented". What is going wrong?</h3>

<p>This means that the device driver does not support the command SMART READ LOG.
<span class="marked">The message does not indicate a hard disk problem!</span>
It does also not mean that the disk itself does not support SMART logs.
It may still be possible to read the logs with a Linux version of smartmontools run from
some <a href="faq.html#bootable">bootable CD</a>.</p>

<p>To access ATA SMART functionality on Windows, smartmontools uses the
I/O control calls
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms804269.aspx"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />SMART_RCV_DRIVE_DATA</a> and
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms803645.aspx"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />SMART_SEND_DRIVE_CMD</a>.
These calls were available since Win95 OSR2.
An example program from Microsoft can be found
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/winddk/sample3/9x/W9X/EN-US/SmartApp.exe"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />here</a>
(the related KB article 208048 is no longer available).</p>

<p>Starting with NT4, these calls do more restrictive parameter checks.
In particular, the command codes for SMART READ LOG and ABORT SELF-TEST
are not accepted. To perform these functions, smartmontools uses the
undocumented functions SCSIOP_ATA_PASSTHROUGH (NT4) or
IOCTL_IDE_PASS_THROUGH (2000/XP) instead.
An example program using these calls can be found
<a href="ftp://ftp.heise.de/pub/ct/listings/0207-218.zip"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />here</a>,
a related newsgroup thread is
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.development.device.drivers/browse_frm/thread/e9763262823e11d1"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />here</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these undocumented functions are not implemented in
most vendor specific ATA device drivers. <tt>Smartctl</tt> prints a
"Function not implemented" message in this case.</p>

<p>A new I/O control call
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms804551.aspx"><img src="pics/linkext.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt="extLink: " />IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH</a>
is available since Win2003 and XP SP2.
It should be supported by most new drivers. Experimental code using
this call was added 2006-04-27 and is included in smartmontools
release 5.37.</p>
